Title    : What else do y'all experience?
Selftext :
I just found this subreddit today and I'm so excited!!! I've always had these weird frogs in my throat, and I'm happy to know that I'm not alone <3

I'm surprised there isn't much research into the issue, but glad to see Dr. Bastian has looked into it and found some relief. Now, I'm curious what else y'all might also be experiencing. 

I don't drink soda or anything heavily carbonated. When I have in the past, I get so bloated that I feel like my body is going to explode.

I have a hard time swallowing pills. Swallowing things in general can be a bit tricky for me if it's something too big.

I get "hiccups" that only happen ounce. But if I get hiccups that last longer than about 3 times, they can be extremely painful. Sometimes my one time hiccups hurt a lot too, though.

Soup is the worst. I love ramen, but it always gives me the worst frog croaks. 

I doubt this one is related, but I have PVC's also. I get chest pain, but I think that's related to the R-CPD rather than my PVC's.

Title    : My gurgle story
Selftext :
I figured only you guys could appreciate this story...

​

It's finals week for me and yesterday I was spending most of my in the computer lab working on them. By 6pm, I had forgotten to eat for most of the day. I had an evening class coming up at 6:30 that goes until 10:20pm, so I knew I had to eat something beforehand or else I'd be starving near the end of it. I rushed to the school cafeteria and grabbed a meal to eat. I should have gotten something like, or at least small, just to tie me over, but no... I got the chinese food because I'm a sucker and wasn't thinking. I inhaled it in a few minutes and went to class. I'm sure most of you know what happened next.... about 20 minutes into class, the frogs started jumping. I spent most of the class just trying to contain my gurgles and hope that no one heard me >< what a mess

​

the chinese food wasn't good, so it wasn't even worth it

Title    : Another DAE post
Selftext :
It's almost 2 am and I can't sleep. Recently I've been having this problem where I wake up coughing, or I start coughing shortly after laying down. It feels like there's hair in the back of my throat right now. 
After a quick Google, I suspect it might be Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (Silent Reflux). I'm no stranger to acid reflux, like most of us are, but I don't have any heart burn or bloating atm. I also made sure to eat 4 hours before bed.
Does anyone have experience with LPR here? Any tricks to help me get a full night of sleep without the coughing?

Edit: I forgot to mention... Yes, I am a non burper. I think maybe I've burped once my whole life. And that could have just been a strong hiccup 🙄

That sounds like it to me. I've never been able to burp, but I didn't get bad heartburn until I was about 24. Now, I have silent reflux that I'm managing through changing my diet around. I get painful hiccups from time to time. The main thing though, I can't burp and a frog lives in my throat.

I'm in the same boat, it doesn't bother me too much tbh (which is lucky because I know a lot of people on this sub have it worse). I get bloated easily, but that helps me not over-eat. I never drink sodas and now I can't drink beer. My boyfriend thinks the frog noises are funny, and he's understanding, so I let them out really loudly when I'm around him. It feels so nice afterwards!

Honestly, I'm such a clueless person sometimes, I didn't realize it wasn't normal until about a few years ago. I assumed everyone else felt this bloating and made weird noises all the time, so I was never embarrassed about accidentally croaking in public.

I mostly get it at night if I eat right before I go to bed. I don't feel heartburn or the traditional acid reflux in my chest. Instead, I have a constant tickle in my throat. Laying down is the worst and I often wake up coughing. It got so bad that I was having a hard time sleeping through the night because I kept waking up to cough. 

I've altered my diet to help avoid it. I stopped eating mayonnaise and other fatty foods as it appeared those are big triggers. I also try not to eat anything 2 hours before I go to sleep

I've never smoked a day in my life and I'm such a goody two shoes that I didn't start drinking until I was 18. And even then, it wasn't too much.
I'm 29 now, but I've never burped since I can remember. I don't think smoking or drinking would cause an issue with it.

Title    : DAE squeeze their boobs together to push air out of their throat?
Selftext :
I was just curious if anyone else does this? What I do is I look directly up with my head back, and I smoosh my boobs together really tightly. I'm not sure why this helps, but whenever I feel an air bubble on the verge of coming up I do that technique and it seems to help push it through.It's definitely not graceful, and I certainly don't do it in public... (like most of you, I just suffer in public). But it helps for those annoying air bubbles that feel like they're stuck in your throat.

It's not nearly as good as a burp or air vomit, sadly. It only really gives me relief for those gurgles that are on the verge of coming out. It always bugs me having this feeling of trapped air right at the top of my chest. So this helps me just get it out there. 
I bet just squeezing on your chest would work, too!

I just switched health insurance plans in order to include Kaiser and Dr. McHugh. But I was wondering how others got a recommendation to see him to get the botox done? Who was your primary care doctor or physician who didn't look at you sideways and sent you to McHugh?

Title    : I have my botox appointment!
Selftext :
I am beyond excited! I live in California and I have Kaiser. I'm not the biggest fan of Kaiser, but I have to admit that they've been pretty helpful with this so far. My primary care doctor took me seriously and recommended me to an ENT. They did the barium swallow test just to rule anything else out (which was actually pretty cool because I got to see the xray videos of myself swallowing. Kind of spooky looking!). And then they sent a camera down my throat. That was less fun. Definitely uncomfortable. But still cool to see my insides again!

​

And now, I've just gotten off the phone with the ENT who is going to be doing the botox. I guess he's done it with some of you other non burpers.

I'm slightly nervous because he said he uses a 'conservative' amount of botox and so far it's only lasted a few months. I guess I'll start with the small amount and go from there.

​

Any advice from people who have gone through the botox? Anyone else here had it done by Dr. Carr in Sacramento?

Title    : Got Botox, now what?
Selftext :
Hey y'all. I got my botox done yesterday. It was the first time trying and I'm starting to feel like it was a bit of a waste.

​

Going through the process of getting to the procedure was great. My primary care doc took me seriously, everyone doing the tests leading up to it were curious and kind about something they had never heard before. Then, I got to the ENT doing the botox, and he kind of brushed it off. During my phone consultation with him, he mentioned that he's done this procedure before and it's pretty routine. I assumed (but shouldn't have) that he was talking about botox for other people who couldn't burp. Turns out, he meant that he does this procedure for people who can't swallow...

​

At my botox appointment, I was very nervous. It was visible by how tense and shaky I was and I told the doctor I was nervous. He didn't do much in the way of trying to calm me down. I wasn't given any numbing agent, no general or local anesthesia. It was shot a straight shot through the skin of my neck. It was uncomfortable. I hated it. It felt like someone put a ball or solid rod in my throat and I couldn't get it out. That's when he mentioned it was only 16 units.... Dr. Bastian does 75.

​

My throat feels fine for the most part. A little hoarse, but nothing major. The back of my neck is sore just because I was so tense yesterday. But I haven't come close to burping. I don't know if it'll happen for me because the dosage was so low.

​

I don't think the doctor, Dr. Carr in Sacramento, read the paper or was interested in learning what R-CPD is. From this subreddit, I've heard there is a doctor in Sacramento that does actually treat R-CPD and with success. I'm not sure how to get to that ENT instead. Should I contact my primary care doctor again? Was there anyone here who has had Dr. Richard McHugh and can help me get in contact with him? Or anyone with the botox that can give me some tips on how to get the burps started?

The barium swallow test would make sense to be negative if the only problem is not burping. However, that should show any issues with swallowing. The best thing you can do is go back to your doctor.

Guys I’m literally so happy! I got scheduled super easily with Dr. Straub I’m Kansas City!! This could literally be lifesaving for me 🥲

These are the daily symptoms that I struggle with:
- The frog gurgles (sooo embarrassing!)
- Hiccups (anyone else?)
- Bloating
- Nausea
- If it gets bad enough, it can also cause hyper-salivation
- Feeling like I’m being suffocated? Not sure how to explain it. I just feel really tight in my stomach and chest. 

Things that I struggle with or can’t do:
- Diving! I want to learn so bad, but being under water makes me feel even worse. Probably from the increased pressure, I would imagine. 
- Working. Especially physical work. Makes my flares last forever too. 

Any advice at all? Or if anyone has seen this specialist, how was he?? 

I also have extreme emetophobia and have been terrified to burp/gag/vomit my whole life. How’s the recovery (if I end up getting this surgery)? 

TIA!!

Selftext :
I was able to see Dr Straub in KC MO, who was recommended to me by someone in this group. Let me tell you all how it went!

For context, I’ve suffered from No-burp symptoms for about 6-7 years now. I never knew what it was until someone on one of my fb groups brought it up. I’ve seen 5 different doctors (before and after I knew about no-burp) and never received an adequate diagnosis. 

Dr. Straub is AWESOME! He is so understanding and thorough with his diagnoses. He explained everything in such amazing detail and I actually recorded the entire conversation with him. I have several new diagnoses;

- Suspected R-CPD 
- Muscle tension dysphonia (which is a voice disorder that can be caused by chronic reflux)
- Silent reflux (if you don’t know what this is, I highly recommend looking into it. I can give more details about what the doctor says about it if anyone is interested). 
- Laryngeal Sensory Neuropathy (chronic cough, increased mucus, dry or sore throat, and frequent throat clearing). 

I’m getting a barium swallow study on Wednesday and I am SO happy to finally have some answers!! If the test comes back positive for R-CPD, then Dr. Straub wants me to try Botox with somewhere between 50-100. Any tips appreciated!

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HELP!!!

Title    : Is bleeding in the throat normal post-Botox?
Selftext :
Hey guys. I just had the surgical Botox injection yesterday and this might be a silly question, but I’m feeling nervous about it. Is it normal to have some bleeding in the throat post-Botox? I have a picture, but it’s just slight bleeding at the back of my throat. I do taste some blood as well. I had the surgery about 18 hours ago. TIA!

Title    : **RANT**
Selftext :
I’m really at a loss here and I feel so defeated and sick. 

I have horrid R-CPD symptoms all day, every day. I have to practically be laying down all day because it is the only thing that helps (even though I also have reflux issues). I got the Botox procedure done at the end of February with 75 units. I hardly ever have any “real” burps. They’re somewhere in between the gurgles and actual burping. Occasionally I will have very small “real” burps, but not often. I have completely changed my diet in the last few weeks. I haven’t had soda in years (besides trying some after the procedure), I don’t drink alcohol, I’ve cut out coffee and caffeine, and I’ve been eating so incredibly healthy. I haven’t been eating sweets or many things with added sugars. 

My dr thinks I may have something else going on along with the R-CPD. I got an EGD/EndoFLIP procedure done yesterday, which only showed a small hiatal hernia. I had an EGD done last year that showed esophagitis, gastritis, and GERD. I’ve also had a barium swallow study that didn’t show anything abnormal. 

I’m really really depressed because of these symptoms. I’m ALWAYS bloated, get frequent hiccups, nausea, slow swallow (still), feel a pressure in my esophagus, esophageal pain if I talk too long or sing, thick saliva at the back of my throat, constantly clearing my throat, etc. I can’t even go into the office anymore for work because by 9 am I’m already feeling like garbage… I usually have to starve myself to feel somewhat normal. 

Does it sound like a failed Botox attempt? Or do I need to get some more testing done? I’m really at a loss. I can’t do anything I enjoy. Cant cook because staying on my feet triggers it, can’t even do my art because I tense up sometimes and I’m sitting up for too long, can’t exercise, can’t even do household chores. 

Any advice or similar experiences are greatly welcomed and appreciated. Thank you for listening. This is honestly impacting my quality of life so much and I’m so so sad all the time 😞

Yes I did!! After I got 75 units, I ended up burping 3 months later and my life is CHANGED!! I feel so much better than I ever have before. The procedure without insurance is about $13k. I’m still (2.5 years later) waiting to see if my insurance will cover it. But it was 100% worth it and I’d do it again. Dr. Straub is AMAZING too. He’s very thorough and kind. He did have me to a barium swallow study first to rule out any other conditions.

Hi! I was wondering if anyone knows of any doctors who do the Botox procedure within a few hours of Washington DC? I’m from northern Virginia and have tried 2 ENT and GI and they all don’t believe me and either 1-think I am just asking for Botox like drugs(who does that?) or 2- tell me that the weird croak sound is burping so I just have to deal with it. They act like my complaint is that I can’t burp instead of hey I have a huge list of symptoms that prevent me from doing my sport or living life. Anyways, I just am so happy to have found a community that not only believes me but has solutions so PLEASE point me in the right direction:))

I’m ready for this to be done I feel so so weak cuz I pretty much can’t get water or food down! On the bright side, definitely burping all the time like an obnoxious amount!

It used to be so bad when I was younger that I had to change the kind of clothes I was wearing. I don't do belts anymore, for instance (I'm female so I have more fashion choices - the whole legging and stretchy pants thing has been a lifesaver).

I saw some people say they learned how to burp. I never thought about it being a learnable skill. Lol, burping, a skill. Who knew! I'll have to try to learn.

I used to do that, too. It's painful with the buildup like that. Luckily, I have never conventionally dated, so I can't help you there. But I would think you would want to find someone mature enough to understand, you know?

My ex-husband always made a big deal out of my constant farting, and we were together for ten years. My ex-boyfriend was gross so it didn't matter. My current boyfriend (going on a year) is the classiest, fanciest person I have ever had the pleasure of having in my life, and he feels that bodily functions aren't something to be embarrassed about and usually don't need to be taken note of. I still have a hard time not saying something when I fart, I'm so socially groomed. Know what I mean?

My symptoms are similar. Just like someone else commented, it's like the feeling that I'm going to vomit and it lasts for a long time. I always thought it could be reflux, so I used to take Tums or something like it, but it doesn't always help. I'm actually thinking that, at least for me, it's gas that other people would normally end up burping out. I relieve these symptoms by lying down with my rear end elevated at least ever so slightly higher than my upper body. It seems to redirect the gas and I have a lot of flatulence instead, which supports my idea that it's trapped gas.

I literally stick my butt up in the air. Like, on my knees, face down, with my butt as up as possible. This has ALWAYS relieved my gas and bloating for me, almost immediately. It's like all the gas travels upwards. But, I saw that you said you've tried yoga poses and things like that and that those didn't help, so this might not even be helpful for you. But I wanted to share just in case you wanted to try it. It literally never fails me. 

Sometimes I also find that I need to pass a bowel movement, but before I can sit on the toilet I have to get the gas out anyway because sometimes I feel so distended/bloated that it's too painful to sit up anyway. But doing these two things in combination always gets the job done for me!

Swallowing uses lots of little muscles in the neck and it ends up connecting to the shoulders somehow, so I get how it could cause a pain in an arm. I don't think what's happening to you is related to noburp, but it could be an injury or neurologic issue. Do you get to see the gastroenterologist soon? If it's expeditious, you could see them, get cleared of issues relating to their speciality, and hopefully move on to a more appropriate specialist. It sucks but as I understand it doctors will refer to broader fields first to rule out as much as possible. I hope you find relief soon!

Title    : Quick question about Botox...
Selftext :
Do you go under general anesthesia for the procedure?

I tried looking it up and it seems like the answer is not always, but that it is more effective if you go completely under because they can't get the needle where it truly needs to go unless you're completely out. 

But I'm also seeing posts where people are repeatedly having the procedure done because the first time didn't last, so I'm wondering if it's normal to be able to withstand going under general anesthesia every few months? I have been under only one time, and it didn't go well, and it took me about a full year to completely recover from it and get back to being able to take my normal meds (ADHD meds) and be able to consume any caffeine whatsoever and for my fatigue levels to improve.

I'm assuming my poor experience with anesthesia was due to POTS, which I am diagnosed with, and I'm in the process of trying to find a doctor who can sit down with me and look at my anesthesia records and tell me what exactly happened and how to prevent those complications in the future. I would really like to have the Botox procedure done and for it to be as effective as possible! But I may need to opt for the local anesthesia variant of the procedure.

So, like, are y'all really out here just going under every few months and your bodies are just totally fine with that and it doesn't mess up your life in a major way? It would be really helpful to know what "normal" is like so that I can better advocate for myself in my medical appointments!

No but I can give you detailed instructions. 

1. Get on hands and knees (tabletop pose--you can search "tabletop pose" for pictures).

2. Bend elbows until forearms rest on ground (or whatever surface you're on).

3. Lower face and chest to the ground (or whatever surface you're on).

That's it!

I think it works because of a combination of gravity (gas travels upwards) and the fact that this position forces your pelvic floor to relax.

Title    : Has anyone dealt with referred pain from trapped gas after abdominal surgery? How long did it take for it to pass for you?
Selftext :
I had surgery 4 days ago. They filled my abdomen with CO2 in order to perform the surgery. This gas gets trapped in the body, and slowly dissipates and gets absorbed by the body and released through the digestive tract. People fart and burp the gas out. 

The referred pain from the gas irritating the phrenic nerve (around the diaphragm) is killer. (The pain gets referred up to the shoulder and neck.) It is by far the worst part of recovery. It seems like most people get done with the gas pain in a couple days, but mine is going on for so long. 

I'm wondering if it's taking longer for me because I can't burp. I have been feeling a lot of gas trapped up in my chest and throat, and I'm not getting as much flatulence as usual, either. That makes sense because the digestive tract slows down so much from anesthesia and pain meds and stuff. 

Has anyone else had abdominal surgery, and how long did it take for you to finally be done with the gas?

I'm following my doctor's advice like walking frequently, eating frequent small meals, drinking peppermint tea, and using heat on my upper back/shoulder/neck. But it's just not enough. And I can't do my usual gas-relief stuff like lying on my stomach or even my side, massaging my intestines, and I'm not even sleeping flat right now because I had chest congestion (don't want to risk pneumonia), so it seems like my gas is having trouble escaping through the back end, too.

Thank you for your sympathy! 😅 I'm glad someone understands lol

Yep, I'm not even using laxatives! I'm thankfully managing through diet. 

Yeah see, the stuff I'm seeing says "better within a couple days," meanwhile I hardly had any pain from it the first two days, and it didn't really start getting a problem until day 3, then so much worse on day 4 (today). 

I had seen so many people saying that the gas pain was the worst part of recovery, so I was definitely thinking "oh, then I'm used to it and it won't be bad" but oh my *god* it is so much more painful than normal! I'm not used to getting the pain in my neck and shoulder. Usually I get pain in my abdomen and I get really distended... I'm barely even bloated now! I thought I would be prepared but I so wasn't prepared 😭

Since making my post, it has improved a lot. But it could just be the ibuprofen. But hopefully it's just going away

I'm so sorry this is happening to you D: When I get those pains, I can't get up and walk around and do anything. I either lie on my stomach, or I kinda... stick my butt up in the air? Like I get face-down on the bed, put my knees under me, and push my butt towards the ceiling. My idea was that gas rises. I don't know if that's why it works for me, but it always gets it moving for me and gives me pretty quick relief.

Title    : Anyone else have the procedure denied by insurance? Anyone appealed it?
Selftext :
I’m employed by the UC system and fully covered by UC Care, which means Dr. Verna at UC Irvine is fully in-network. (Amazing, I thought). I set an appointment for next month but it got denied today by Anthem Blue Cross. Verna did a doctor-to-doctor follow-up with them and they still denied. Now it’s up to me. 

It’s just a generic appeal process through their website, and the cynic in me feels like it's a non-starter. Regardless I’m prepared to explain why it’s fully justified. (I have a chart full of their GI visits that helped nothing). Any shared experience or advice appreciated!

Anthem denied by appeal (more specifically IngenioRx denied it because they are Anthem's pharmacy benefit manager). Apparently they are changing to Navitus next year so I'm wondering if it's worth appealing again at the start of 2022 or just saying screw it and booking something with Bastian.

Title    : Got my Anthem denial overturned
Selftext :
I'd basically accepted that the procedure would not be covered after two Anthem denials, but I went about the third-party External Review (the final option) just to see the process through. To my surprise, it worked! In case it's helpful, I've pasted some bullet points below that I included in my appeal. The rest of the appeal letter focused on my personal symptoms and experience. 

I also linked two the two Bastian studies and this screenshot of a California Department of Managed Health in which the described reason for overturning a past denial (as a sort of precedent). https://i.imgur.com/IOxLJl6.png

HERE IT IS: 

The following facts support coverage of Botox to treat this disorder. 

- Botox is widely prescribed by doctors and covered by insurance as medical treatment, including as a muscle relaxant like in this case. 
- Botox is covered by Anthem for neurogenic dysphagia--a tightening of the exact same throat muscle to address a swallowing disorder. It’s even more effective treating R-CPD.
- Dr. Robert Bastian has published several peer-reviewed studies demonstrating the clear effectiveness of Botox in treating R-CPD. (Abstracts attached)
- The California Department of Managed Health Care has precedent for overturning a denial of this exact procedure (Attached): “The requested esophagoscopy and injection of cricopharyngeus muscle with 50-75 units of botulinum toxin are medically necessary for treatment of this patient’s medical condition … The health plan’s denial should be overturned.”  

If you've had coverage denied, maybe that can be helpful. Good luck!

Title    : Would you say a burp is something that is actively pushed out or something that escapes through relaxation?
Selftext :
Nine days post procedure, microburping sporadically and have legit burped maybe 1.5 times. 

I know the upper esophageal sphincter itself needs relaxation, hence Botox, but would you say burping is an act of bodily relaxation allowing the gas out, or an active push once the air presents itself as ready to escape? 

Maybe some combination of both? Probably overthinking it but that kinda seems like what this phase is for.

Same exact scenario for me. Gurgles are there but don’t really bug except in the occasional intimate moment when suddenly they seem extra loud lol. Bloating and digestive pain on the other hand is daily and chronic and by far the main issue. 

I’m about two weeks removed from Botox and burping is hard but it’s happening. It’s not natural or even close to normal sounding so far, but I do have the ability to let off that air before it hits the stomach and digestive track. I was a little afraid that because gurgles weren’t super strong that maybe I would have a hard time getting up the air to burp. Hasn’t been the case, and now I’m hyper aware of the gurgles because those are what become the burps. 

It’s a lot of work practicing and trying to burp still but I can say for the last week I’ve gone to bed with a normal feeling, non bloated stomach. That’s after having bubbly water or even beer. Pretty crazy.

I got mine on the same day and had a slow first week, then by the second week I was cranking my head far to the side and I could force burps out. It was way too strained and sounded real grumbled, but it got the air out and I experienced a couple days without symptoms, which was cool. Then I had a couple days where I could tell I was forcing it too much, and sometimes not burping. I'd get stressed if I drank carbonation and didn't burp, so I eased back to relax a little and start fresh. 

In week three the generous redditor shared the shoulders-back, tennis-ball-in-throat video. I was able to replicate that the first night I tried and it was a much much more natural burp... air escaping rather than being forced. I found I had to relearn that motion each day, and sometimes it took all day. I even had a two day stretch where I pretty much couldn't do it. (Easy to get in your head and convince yourself it won't work!)

Over the last week I've found a rhythm and while the burps are small, I can more often than not do the motion from that video to let them out. My head goes a little to the side and I don't open my mouth as wide, but it's the same basic motion. 

Some days I've had no symptoms, some days I've had them quite a bit. I'm focusing on learning that motion more than I am on trying to burp everything out like I was that first week. 

It's so interesting how up and down it is. It truly does feel like you have to be constant about exploring and practicing and training. 

Oh also: I haven't had any of the reflux or struggling with swallowing symptoms. I find that I have to chase vitamins with water, but otherwise it's mostly normal. I feel lucky in one sense, but in another I think it might mean the challenge of burping is heightened. I had 80 units, but the side effects have been pretty mild. 

Happy one-month Botox-aversary tomorrow AmyKittiesGalore!

Title    : Post botox: Gurgle people vs. bloated people
Selftext :
I had the procedure one month ago and I'm slowly getting better at it, although it comes in fits and starts. 

I've made good progress this week specifically and found that if I can send that air upward to the right place, I can usually count on myself to burp it out, even if it takes a few tries and it's pretty small. 

But if I don't consciously work to get it up there, it moves through just the way it always would, even if I slam a bubbly water or whatever. It got me doing some unqualified theorizing... 

I was way more prone to bloating and farting and all that wonderful stuff than I was to gurgles. I'd get the gurgles but it didn't bug me too much and it wasn't constant.

I'm thinking the procedure might be a bit more effective for those prone to gurgles (rather than bloating) because that air is naturally making its way upward on a regular basis. It's just a matter of letting it out the deadened muscle. 

I obviously have no idea, but as I've gotten better at the burping part, I've realized that I need to get better at the part where I even send that air upward to the UES in the first place. 

Any smart people have thoughts or feelings on this?

So interesting how different! I drank a smoothie on the way home from the procedure expecting it to be difficult but it was just mildly different. By the next day I was eating normally (although vitamins often kind of get hung up in there when I swallow them). 

But the flip side of that coin is that the burping journey is rough. It feels like everything will just remain the same unless I exercise it every day before the Botox recedes. I'm able to burp in a way I wasn't but I don't think the muscle is as deadened as people who feel those strong effects. 

On one hand I feel lucky that my daily life is pretty normal. On the other I'm jealous of the full effects in the long run. I hope it gets better for you soon!

I'm about two months post and it's been up and down. I found forced, unnatural burps after a week or two, then a more natural kind (using the video linked below) that were a lot smaller around a month. I've found and lost it multiple times since and am similarly hesitant about drinking carbonation midday because there's no guarantee I'll be burping it up. I've honestly drank beer more often than normal lately because it combines carbonation with a relaxant that keeps me from overthinking. A midday La Croix (something I'd never do in my normal life) tightens me up. A few beers has been weirdly effective, and I've started to be able to replicate that more natural process more during the day even without carbonation lately. Just need to dial it back as the burping becomes more natural lol. 

The stuff about the diaphragm mentioned above is huge I think. This whole process has made me realize that I basically don't REALLY breathe. Not with my diaphragm at least. Just shallow breaths up by my throat. I'm realizing the role the diaphram plays not only in the burping but also the massaging and digesting of food and movement of gas out the bottom end. Def gonna try that shaker version described in this thread. Wishing you the best!

Selftext :
I’m about 2.5 months post Botox and burping pretty well, and in a way that I hope will sustain. Here’s something I discovered late in the process… 

Carbonation gets discussed a lot and understandably so, but I’ve found a ton of value in morning coffee (with a little bit of food) and tea (after a meal). I imagine it further relaxes the throat. But you need some gas in the body too obviously. 

I hope this isn’t only true while there’s still some Botox but I plan to keep it going for the next few months to see. Anyone?

It'd make sense! All of those moving parts are kind of part of "digestion," we just don't really think of it that way. We think of digestion just as what happens in the intestines, but it's really everything that happens between eating and pooping. The English are onto something!

Ya know I'm not sure! I will say that tea never made me nauseous even in the past, but I drank it sparingly so maybe on some subconscious level I avoided it. But as I work on burping post-Botox, it seems as simple as the warmth of it softening that muscle and allowing burps out. Whether that will remain true forever or if it's just something that exaggerates the Botox, we shall see! But I'm enjoying tea life!

Yeah that's tough. I had occasional gurgles but bloat was the thing that was ruining my life. I bet there are people in here who experience them in equal parts, I don't want to pretend that I did. What I will say is that doing yoga and paying a ton of attention to breathing during the botox months was a huge part of me finding a groove with burping and digesting and exploring all of this. (I learned that I basically don't automatically breathe past the shallow breaths into my throat... bad for everything including digestion). Feels like a hippy thing I don't want to tell people but doing that alongside Botox was a bit part of it for me.

Title    : Wrote a song about the burp procedure -- "Orange County Drug"
Selftext :
This song is about a lifelong inability to burp and the subsequent Botox treatment that cured it. I had it done in Orange County, where many get Botox for a whole other reason. That was funny and poetic to me so I wrote a song about it (with the goal of nobody outside the non-burping community being able to know what the hell I was talking about). But above all else it's about not feeling miserable during the line life you've got.

**Listen:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjD-KodTCOU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjD-KodTCOU)

This song and others can be found on Spotify, Apple, Bandcamp, etc. under the name [**Routine Layup**](https://routinelayupmusic.bandcamp.com/album/seasonal-compression).

**ORANGE COUNTY DRUG** 

Last night I booked a flight into Santa Ana, California   
Got an appointment there tomorrow   
A lifetime of pressure building up behind our busted bodies  
An Orange County drug down there swallow 

Got pills and pesticides to neutralize the common nature   
Got our Creator on Her heels   
Days spent navigating ailments we'll examine later  
Spun every symptom on the wheel 

Know it sounds stupid but it's real --  
We die, we die, we die, after we're  
alive, alive, alive,  so  lean into the light  
light, and light, and light,   
Do what you gotta do  
To feel alright--

Back to Seattle with a silent toxin in my body   
Throat chakra shocked and fast asleep   
Take time to moderate my breath and drink  La Croix, and I'll be  
Putting my diaphram on the beat 

Lifetime of learning how to breathe-- 

We die, we die, we die, after we're  
alive, alive, alive, lean into the light  
light, and light, and light,   
Do what you gotta do  
To feel alright--

I had it and experienced some of the initial success right after the procedure, but could feel it fading as months went on. For totally separate reasons I started yoga a month or two after the procedure and realized that whatever combination of relaxation/breathing was helping burp more naturally. But it was fading so I got it again about 4 months after the first time and focused on breathing mainly via yoga from the jump and it worked great, still burping. Glad I did it that second time.

Title    : So many questions...
Selftext :
I haven't burped in all 25 years of my life and I'm very close to scheduling an appointment for the Botox treatment, but have a few questions:

1) I'm hoping to go to James E. Kuderer in St. Louis Park, MN. Does anyone know if this is commonly treated there? I'm nervous to go to someone who hasn't dealt with it many times. Nobody I've seen so far has ever heard of it or dealt with it.

2) I've never had acid reflux, just the major gurgling noises, otherwise no acid reflux/heartburn. Has the botox procedure caused anyone (who hasn't had acid reflux before) to have it? And if so, how long have you had it, or did it go away eventually?

3) What were your side effects? I want to hear them all! I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into...

​

Thanks everyone! I'm so glad I found this group!

I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but when I'm getting the throat gurgles, or feel them coming on, most of the time a cup of milk will calm it down for a bit. I'm not sure why, but personally it helps me feel a little better!

Has anyone else found this helps them too? Usually only laying down on my back helps, but the milk is a plus sometimes.

After having my insurance deny coverage for the botox not once, but twice, I'm finally surrendering and will be paying for botox out of pocket since the procedure itself is covered. I'll be going with Dr. Kuderer in St. Louis Park, MN, and I'm very nervous, but very excited. 

How long did it take for those who have had the procedure to feel okay? I have a wedding 2 days post-op and I'm assuming I won't want to go, but I was curious if normal activities/talking a lot/physical activity are feasible right after! I realize eating will be difficult...yay. 

Any advice on what to expect pre/post-op would be much appreciated! :)

Hey everyone! I'm one week post injection and I've had microburps since the day after. I still have them, but I REALLY have to turn my head to the left. So much that where I push my face to turn it farther is sore. At what point were you able to get a burp out \*intentionally?\* I cannot forcibly push them out for the life of me.  I've been practicing with sparkling water also, but still can't force them unless I crank my head as far left as possible. 

Thanks in advance!

I got home and made soup right away. Soup was really easy to eat, and like everyone else says, make sure you have something to drink to help it go down. I also was in the boat of feeling like I could probably eat anything as long as I chewed enough and had water. But Soup was a great thing to start with.

No problem! I was fortunately able to, yes. Everything will feel like it's getting stuck before it goes down, but don't panic, it's completely normal! It's just a "slow swallow" and should go down just fine with enough water. 

I did make the mistake a few times of drinking too fast. I'd get really thirsty and take multiple swallows of water at a time, and then would find myself struggling which was uncomfortable, but bearable.

Happy to help! It's definitely a weird experience/feeling post-procedure, but in my case it's been all fairly easy luckily. The best way I could describe how I felt right after was as if I were holding back tears, like you're doing your absolute best not to cry, lump in my throat kind of feeling. More neck pain from being in a weird position with tubes down my throat than anything. 

I would do it 100x over if I had to. The relief is SO worth it. I'm just over a week post-op and it really is life changing. No more pain/pressure after eating or drinking once you're able to release air! Just be patient and practice with carbonation as soon as you feel comfortable! Good luck!

I didn't get many post op instructions other than to eat soft, wet food and chase with water. And take ibuprofen as needed.

I started trying carbonation two days after my procedure. I could get a few micro burps, but only if I turned my head wayyyyy left. That worked for a while until my neck got sore haha. I would also get micro burps every time I yawned. Then I realized if I push my neck forward, that worked much better for getting the air out and they're quickly turning into legitimate burps. I just drink  sparkling water to practice and it's been going great.

Title    : Unable to Swallow
Selftext :
i’m emetaphobic and i had an experience last july that really made my anxiety go crazy. when i started school that september i spent the whole school day drinking water trying to stop the gurgles but i find that water makes it worse eventually. after i drink so much water i’m eventually unable to swallow and start gagging. but then as soon as i get home from school and lie down they stop. 

This used to happen like once a week in school but now it’s everyday. i had an endoscopy in june and they said that everything is perfectly ok and that i might just have a sensitive stomach. but i failed to mention to the doctor about my no burping symptoms so maybe he wasn’t looking for the right things.

Anyway i was wondering if there’s things that can help the gurgling and swallowing issues or any foods and drinks i should avoid before and during school because that’s when it’s at it’s worse.

i don’t know if this applies for what country your in but for me if you’re under the age of 18 you can get a full anesthetic so i didn’t have to worry about waking up during the procedure or anything. i was really nervous about the endoscopy at first cause i didn’t want to get sick after it, as nausea was said to be a symptom, but i felt fine my throat just hurt really bad for a few days and then it became less sore. and i don’t think you need an endoscopy to find it out because the doctor didn’t even diagnose me with it he just said i might have a sensitive stomach. but i also didn’t know how to explain the gurgles to him so he might of not been looking for it. anyways the endoscopy was easy and you don’t have to worry about it. i didn’t feel nauseous at all, i didn’t gag and i didn’t get sick, and coming from someone who can feel extremely nauseous at anything it says a lot. hope this helped.

Plenty of insurance companies cover it if the doctor can prove it’s medically necessary!

But yes stick with it. Keep pounding carbonated drinks. Turn your head all around. It’s not one sized fits all. Different people get burps different ways. Stimulating the muscle is the idea!

Very good points. And adding hurdles to an already rare diagnosis is messed up. I would only caveat that my ENT said he found two patients with different issues than RCPD and it saved a wasted treatment and a bigger problem later. That’s exceedingly rare as he’s done the procedure a lot now. But I bet he feels like he did right by those two patients.

I will say I was very anal about calling ahead of time and discussing the pre authorization with my insurance company to make sure they didn’t think it was vanity Botox!

I am so sorry to hear that. It was a massive concern of mine given the nature of Botox. I don’t know enough about the process to truly help. Only thing I’d say is Bastian does them for a very reasonable out of pocket rate. Or at least used to when I looked into it. Chicago is a far way away and that would be a process but it would likely be the cheapest way. OHP doesn’t cover so many things it’s terrible.

Title    : First appointment down, now I need your help!
Selftext :
Hey fellow non-burpers! I had my initial appointment with Dr T in Atlanta last week and it went well! The good news is that he said I fit the criteria for the procedure, however, because I have LPR reflux, and celiac disease, he mentioned that I could be trading one ailment for another. By relaxing the muscle to let air up and out, could also increase heartburn. I’ve been in Nexium for over 8 years so truthfully I am at the point where I don’t remember if I ever felt true heartburn or if it was always just the silent reflux (LPR). So here I am, wondering, wouldn’t the Nexium take care of the reflux anyway if I had the procedure done? 
Let me know your thoughts! 
Dr T was very honest, he’s performed about 19 of these procedures, all of which  there were no complications, only a few people didn’t really get the results they were thinking they would. ie super burpers haha.

Title    : Botox units and age?
Selftext :
Hey all! 
  Just had my second Botox procedure on Valentine’s Day (haha)! I had the procedure done for the first time in July 2023 and the doctor injected 50 units that time. I only experienced a handful of microburps about 2 weeks after the procedure and then that was it. 
The second round (with the same doctor) just last week, he injected 75 units this time. I started having microburps the same night. They haven’t gotten much bigger (yet?) but I am curious if the number of units injected and age has any effect on how well it works. For example, I am 38 almost 39 years old and all my life, never burped so that muscle has to be extremely tight, right?
I wonder how many units you all have had and your age and success or lack of success?

Also, will my burps get bigger? I started drinking sodas a couple days after as instructed by my doctor. 
Thanks all!

Hi! Congrats on your upcoming procedure! 
I have had the procedure twice, first was in 2023 and had too little number of units injected so it was not successful (50 units first time). 
I just had the procedure done again at 75 units on February 14th (lovely valentines gift to myself haha). Same night I had microburps begin. To answer your questions:
1: slow swallow occurred with everything, chew slow and take small bites. Sip of water after each bite. It does go away! I’m still experiencing the slow swallow as we speak. 
2: nothing from the procedure itself will prevent you from working out a week after, but, when lifting weights, we use our core and there’s a lot of pressure put into it so you may experience some unplanned burps lol. But as far as the procedure, they say give yourself 24 hours for the anesthesia to leave your body, drink lots of water and you’re good to go. 
3: lots of uncontrolled burps currently but mostly when laughing (pressure from the belly) and some small ones escaping while talking but hardly noticeable. I haven’t gotten out of this phase yet so I don’t know how long it takes to begin controlling them yourself 
Good luck!!!

Title    : Thinking of trying something...
Selftext :
Out of frustration for not being able to fucking burp I've just absolutely had enough of this shit.

I'm thinking about buying gallons of sodas and consuming them in great quantities over the course of around a week. Swallowing litres of the stuff in one go and then running to the bathroom to 1) Gag up all the gas, and then 2) Vomit everything else out.

It's my hoping that doing this a few times a day over the course of a week will somewhat strengthen the muscles involved in forcing all that gas out and hopefully along with some cricoid massaging (that I hope I'm doing correctly) I could maybe manage a non-forced burp by the end of the week.

I just want to be normal.

Unfortunately it's not taken seriously at all, but you have to understand that doctors are not taught about this and it's extremely rare. It's not on their radar until you go in and see them so they are likely to be skeptical.

It is a horrible issue and your situation does sound like a lot around here. 

I am seeing a GP next week in hopes of getting a referral, but the people to know are Dr Bastian (USA) and Dr Karagama (UK) who you will hear mentioned an awful lot around here. It might be worth contacting either one of them directly to see if you have any viable options

I understand exactly how you feel as I went to a competitive sport university - no way was I keeping up with all the drinking! 

There is serious hope for us in the Botox treatment, so sorting that out for yourself should be priority number 1.

Currently I'm trying to fight the good fight for this cause by seeking referral through the NHS and raise awareness to medical professionals of actual treatment options. Whilst I wait, I'm taking a tablespoon of inositol in mornings and evenings, then gagging myself whenever I feel uncomfortable from gas. I've theorised before that this method should allow one to learn to burp and I want to report back to this sub with my findings before having the surgery if at all!

You're not alone!

I've been taking inositol for about 2 months but with no routine or structure to it. I find it SO much easier to gag air out by sticking fingers down my throat when I've had inositol.

Although inositol hasn't made me able to burp outright, making it easier to gag air has already been a great relief for me and it gives  me more control over being comfortable!

In the past two months I've also experienced about 20 microburps and when I gag the air out it actually sounds like a burp now!! I still can't force myself to burp, but I think I'm close to a breakthrough

Title    : Graduated to microburps... where do I go from here?
Selftext :
Hello all.

Up to last year, gas had only ever left my mouth during violent (rare) alcohol induced vomiting and now I have roughly 3-5 gas releases a day, I don't have control over them though.

I've reached this point through the use of inositol, "throwing up air" at least once a day, and a couple of sessions of forcing myself to vomit after drinking large quantities of fizzy water

I feel so close to burping, even just now I inadvertently got rid of gurgles through a microburp!!! The stuff of dreams!!

Has anyone gone past this stage to controlling their burps? How did you do it now you have the gas release action occuring?

Oh and also, if you're having a hard time throwing up, tilting your head way to the left will bring up your last meal if you try enough. You've been warned!!

Great post and amazing work for you to find your cure!

I have very recently taught myself how to burp without the botox injection and will be making a similarly detailed post to include signs + symptoms, as well as all possible ways to help cure yourself.

I admit I am paranoid that any day I will revert back to how I was before, so I am drinking lots of soft drinks and beer to make the most of this time! 

This has the double purpose of reminding the body that there is nothing to fear in releasing gas and to help it become a natural movement. I recommend to do whatever you can to increase burping in this phase of recovery

The Wikipedia page for belching currently says the following for the belching dysfunction. Perhaps we can add some more to this based on any studies by Dr Bastian or Dr Karagama?


"Inability to burp is uncommon, and chest pain caused by dysfunction of the belch reflex is rare.[8]"


Better yet, if anyone knows any medical students who might be willing to study this for a thesis or dissertation. This needs to be recognised by medicine.

Yes like you I became increasingly fixated on the discomfort and anxiety it causes DAILY. Overall it took me about 3 months to get to this stage.

I am currently on holiday with only my phone but the TL;DR version is:

1. DO THE SHAKER EXERCISE

Videos on YouTube for how to do this properly. Do this every night (and morning if you want) until your neck is sore! This is the most important thing to do and others have taught themselves to burp this way. This strengthens your "burping muscle". Don't be lazy with this exercise, I would do it until I couldn't lift my neck anymore.

2.MAKE YOURSELF GAG AND "VOMIT" AIR

This is important to teach your body how it feels for gas to come up from your stomach. It also makes the whole thing less gross the more you do it, and most of us have a fear of vomiting so this is important. I took this a step further and forced myself to actually throw up many times  after drinking lots of soda. Idk if this helped but it made vomiting less scary for me.

Throwing up air once each day if possible will help you to make the connection with your throat with what it should feel like. You will get better at this over time and it will get less painful. 


I can't say it has changed my life, but I'm so relieved to be making progress now. The other day I drank 5 beers and was fine! You can do it too! :D

As MDEGTFC says.. make yourself throw up air

I taught myself to burp and a big part of that was knowing what it feels like to release trapped air from the stomach. I learnt to burp after a few weeks of doing it after every big meal.

Now I am cured thanks to sticking through with my theory.  Life is good once you can move on from this issue! It is easier than you think 

Also do the shaker exercise DAILY (vids on YouTube)

You get better over time. It's all about teaching your body to relax and let air out through a way that is basically always shut.

The amount of gas will depend on how much you ate / drank.

Basically just don't do it immediately, listen to your body. For me it was about 10-15 minutes.

Sometimes it will feel like you are about to vomit, but often that is a phantom sensation caused by the air! 

I am so happy you are doing this. I did it every day at breakfast and dinner, sometimes extra by drinking fizzy drinks :D I am now cured! So I think it's good you can put the fear aside and go for it.

I always did it standing up straight :) You will be able to tell if you are about to vomit - trust me! I think standing up straight is better if you only want to release air, and bending over is helpful if you want to vomit.

Title    : Cured no-burpers.. has your appetite changed?
Selftext :
I've been burping for 2 months now, and nowadays my hunger never goes away. I'm eating like a fucking train. 

My theory is my stomach was getting stretched every meal by the gas, thus making me feel full - now the only way for this to happen is to fill that space with food.

I've been skinny my whole life up to now but suddenly I'm putting on weight :o Anyone else relate!?

I also think there is a connection to being a fussy eater as well. The nasty tastes that come up with burps kind of desensitize you to gnarly flavours that noburpers would never experience.

Yes! I've been meaning to make a post about curing myself for a while but I haven't fully fleshed out all of my ideas yet ;)

There are two very crucial things which I believe made the most difference.

**"Throwing up air""**

This is common practice around here on a night of drinking, or to make the nauseous feeling go away after a big meal. Making yourself gag opens up the pathway that links to your stomach and releases that gas. I always figured that by doing this enough you could train yourself to simulate that action, as it is the same thing as burping [it also involved doing some *actual* vomiting, but I don't know how helpful this was](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/71ujw8/thinking_of_trying_something/). I was "throwing up air" at least 2 times every day and forcing myself to drink fizzy drinks and having big meals so that I could do even MORE air vomits. I'm talking drinking 4L+ of sparkling water on weekends and dozens of trips to the bathroom. Eventually you learn to be very comfortable with the process, and it doesn't take much encouragement to get out of your body once you've trained the action. 

**Shaker Exercise**

People have cured themselves by doing this exercise **alone**. No botox, no gagging, just plain old exercise. Hard to say how it works, but many theorize it strengthens the throat muscles around the closed one - thus taking away some of the tension from the constantly tense muscle. Once it has relaxed a bit, it will open up at random occasions when there is enough pressure in your stomach. I used to experience a burp once every day for about three months and had no control over it. This was after roughly 6 weeks of doing the shaker exercise, and doing it so hard I made myself tired and unable to move my neck. This exercise is definitely to be taken seriously. No slacking! [I did it this way, but made it harder by having my shoulders on the edge of my bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGkgiC6nZyc)


**BONUS ROUND: Go on Holiday and walk for 12 hours a day**

Funnily enough I was walking around Tokyo when I experienced my first controlled burp after a meal. This was after two days of nonstop walking, so I can only imagine that helped!

As I said, I will post all this information sometime along with more theories I have about the condition \^-^ I hope your husband finds this useful!

First I want to start with this: glad to see that you recognize this at 18. I personally didn't realize why I was so sensitive to alcohol/beer until several years after I was introduced to it; I just thought I "couldn't handle my alcohol" which produced some anxieties about the drinking/party culture as a whole which ultimately turned me off from drinking and to this day I still miss out on some quality time with my friends who do drink. So good on you for being aware of this and finding a solution!

When I do drink on occasion, I try and lean toward spiked teas, mixed drinks, or the very occasional shot of some kind of hard alcohol (whiskey for me mainly). As far beer, for some reason, sour beers are easier for me to drink than a typical lager. Not sure why, but if you don't mind their taste I would maybe give that shot too. Good luck!

Title    : What is the biggest impact no burp has had on your life?
Selftext :
TL;DR at the end.

I am interested to know how no burp has impacted your life at large, and what butterfly effect-esque scenarios took place that put you where you are in life.

For me (27M), I've known I couldn't burp for a really long time, at least over a decade, but I'd never attributed any of my hardships to it because I didn't recognize any correlations until I found this subreddit a handful of years ago- *ding ding ding! I'm not alone!*

After being giddy over finding my people, I naturally started looking back on my life and connecting some dots. There was a party in high school during which I drank half a beer and had to rush to the bathroom to throw up (I am not emetophobic; I feel like I can do anything in the world when I finally vomit/release the pressure). That night and many nights after, I got a lot of flack for "not being able to handle my alcohol" etc. from several people and although I laughed it off, it did kind of hurt my feelings and made me a little nervous about parties/drinking. Like any teenager, I just wanted to be liked and included, and it didn't help that we had a whole other town of new kids join us for high school that I wanted to befriend. Reminder: at this time I didn't really know what no burp was/how it was affecting me, so I brushed off the teases and continued to accept invites and do my best to fit in by nursing my drinks and pretending like I wasn't wildly uncomfortable. But all of that physical and emotional discomfort that was seemingly out of my control developed into strong anxieties and fears surrounding the party scene *(everyone* is *looking at me, right?).*

Years passed and I had mostly come to terms with the fact that drinking beer made me uncomfortable and I had a strong suspicion that it was in some way tied to my inability to burp. At that point in my life (probably 22ish) I didn't feel too judged about telling people "I don't really drink" but I was still uncomfortable in bars and other public places that beer was the only thing largely available (peer pressure, y'know?). So when my friends started going out to the city for parties and drinks, I was reluctant to decline most invites because I knew I was missing out on quality time with my friends. This continued to happen for years leading up to the past few years when, unfortunately, I stopped being invited to a lot of things in general- group chats without me, leading to hangouts without me, leading to more plans without me that lots of the time didn't even revolve around drinking. Massive FOMO for me sometimes.

Being cognizant of how I got to where I am has been helpful, and I have matured to a level that I can definitely handle myself in uncomfortable situations, but it stinks to realize that I am not as close to my friends these days as I'd like to be. I've been adamant about pushing myself back into a central part of the group to some avail but I also feel like if I'd just been able to burp in the first place, I wouldn't necessarily be in this position. I am content with my life and the ways things turned out for me, but I'm sure we all have a story we can track back to no burp in some way. What's yours?

TL;DR: No burp caused discomfort at parties leading to anxiety at parties leading to declining invites to drink, leading to not getting invited to most regular hangouts, leading to feeling left out a lot of the time and sometimes it's all I think about.

Right. This sub has a lot of support, and I'd like to imagine that is there is one safe space for people who struggle with something because of no burp and want to talk about it without judgement to someone who actually understands, this would be the place.

I know my story was more on the negative side, but that's not all I seek from anyone willing to share a slice of no burp life. Something majorly positive is that someone decided to create this subreddit one day, I googled no burp on a whim when I was experiencing symptoms, found this sub, found a sense of community regarding a mild and quite unique struggle I've had, and now I connect with people like you about it!

It stinks that you experience so much pain and that it has a direct impact on your day to day. Some people have no idea how difficult something like this can be for another person sometimes. 

I often feel like there's *something else* going on when I experience other weird pains in my body or a discomfort that I can't quite put my finger on, which makes me want to learn to burp/have the surgery so I can diagnose any left over symptoms god forbid there would be any.

I will personally usually wait until I'm alone/around close family to let go of any big loud ones. I get a real kick out of seeing my family's disgusted faces or hearing them say "omg what did you eat?!" when I really push.

Before I was aware of the abnormality of the noises I was making, I would casually gurgle around co workers at an old job. When I realized that my baby dinosaur noises were really weird to other people, I quickly began to suppress them. I hate loud chewers and inconsiderate noise-makers so to this day feel really bad about all the times I just let the gurgles happen in public. It's a real wonder why people were still kind to me, or why I wasn't curious that other people weren't doing the same thing.

I can’t remember any specific moments in my early relationships/schooling being embarrassed specifically because of no burp (loud grumbling stomach in geometry late morning because I never ate breakfast, yes), but I also can’t ever remember burping in my life either. So maybe at that age I was thankfully entirely symptomless? Who knows! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

It’s gotten slightly more noticeable/sensitive in recent years but thankfully it isn’t terrible physically for me day to day. I’m turning 28 next Sunday so happy early birthday and let’s hope we don’t get worse with age!

As rare as no burp is, as funny/fake it may seem to people, it *is* a legitimate excuse to not partake in drinking (not that anyone needs an excuse other than they don't want to) and is not lame. Unfortunately for me I didn't know of my legitimate excuse when the drinking started and instead put myself through some bad nights that left a lasting impression just because I thought that I should fit in and I wanted to so badly.

It's a tough time in college when everyone turn 21 and it's more or less expected of you to go out and get smashed all the time, but can't, but also don't want to be left out. So my advice to you that I wish I'd been told back then: don't torture yourself, make sure your friends understand your condition because there is nothing worse than being peer pressured into pain, and being able to not burp is actually very cool and the typical person is really interested to learn about it. I've found that most people "would die if they couldn't burp" so it's a huge flex when they learn that we live like this every day. Use your uniqueness to your advantage instead of letting it hinder you. But most importantly, again, don't torture yourself. In a few years, everyone's will to get shitfaced every night will subside, and the ones that continue on that path might not be the best friend material anyway.

You seem to have a handle on how this affects you already so good for you for being aware, and good luck in your 21st year!

Title    : Pain in lungs/chest when breathing?
Selftext :
I’ve lived with no burp my whole life (28M) and can also remember for the last several years having the occasional sharp pain in what feels like my left lung sort near the heart when I breathe.  Maybe a couple times a month. It’s usually a small stabbing pain in one small area, and only at a certain level of inflation of the lungs. Sometimes it last for a couple minutes, sometimes it’ll linger for a couple hours.

I’ve read that a pain like this can be linked to the esophagus among other things so I’m curious if anyone here experiences this. 

And don’t worry, I plan to make a doctors appointment at least for a check up anyhow.

My best advice is to lean into your inability to burp and take ownership of your gurgles! The anxiety surrounding your situation could be exacerbating the discomfort and nausea, and if you can get past that then your problems won't be nearly as bad! And remember, however uncomfortable you get, you're pretty unique to have the condition we're all here for and people are way more accepting of it than you think- they actually tend to be really interested in your baby dinosaur noises. In a day and age where all kinds of people with differing in/abilities are more likely to be accepted, us no burpers have a really cool niche!

It might be annoying to deal with in a classroom or lecture hall but at least when it comes to your friends, they're your friends and eventually you'll end up sharing a laugh when you get a nice loud gurgle around them. Seriously, take ownership of it. It's only a curse if you want it to be.

My second best advice is stay away from carbonated beverages. Stick to wine or liquor if you find yourself at a party. Juices over sodas.

I’m having a Hot Ones party in a week and it just occurred to me that no burp can exacerbate the effects of eating incredibly spicy food. I can handle heat alright until several hours later when it feels like there is acid burning holes in my stomach, but I think that’s a pretty normal occurrence when anyone eats spicy food?

Has anyone done the Hot Ones challenge?

Avoiding stress is a big help for me when it comes to exercising and eating. It makes it much easier to only do what you are comfortable with. 

I’m around the same age and went from 135 to 165 this past year by hitting the gym a few times a week, trying to lift on the heavier side but never overexerting myself, and by making a big tasty protein shake when I get home that I drink at my own slow pace. Don’t force meals down your throat because you feel like that’s the “right way” to bulk. When you are hungry, eat. Try to stick to high protein foods. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like it’s nobody’s business, or if I’m feeling lazy I go full spoon in the PB. Overnight oats can be a good start to the day too.

Just be as consistent as you can and don’t force yourself to do anything that will make you feel worse. That is a surefire way to lose motivation.

I also find liquids so much easier to consume throughout the day that sometimes when I’m a little hungry instead of a small snack I’ll chug a glass of milk haha. And my overnight pats are drinkable. Find your mix and good luck!

I wanna be cured but I don't trust anyone lol.
There's probably none who knows this condition in Finland.

I feel like I gurgle air all the time with my mouth closed or open it doesn't matter. It stops when I lie down its quiet but I don't have gurgle sounds every second lol. Idk.

Title    : how do you drink from the bottle?
Selftext :
Once my speech therapist asked me to bring a bottle of water and drink during the next visit, I didn't know what he meant, recently I discovered the topic of not burping (r-cpd), due to the lack of a doctor dealing with botox treatment in my country (Poland) and reading that there is a chance that the procedure for 2 of my payments in a few weeks/months may return to its previous state. I found various exercises to stretch and strengthen the neck and started doing them regularly (1-2 weeks ago). I don't see any results yet, but many people praise them.
But coming to the main story, I connected all these facts, speech therapist, water bottle, r-cpd, weak neck muscles
and I ran into such a problem, after all, I always drank in such a way that I sucked the bottle, which made it crumple, I touched the bottle's spout with my upper lip, which made the water bottle much lower than when drinking (in my opinion normally), not sucking the bottle, raising it higher, what do I need to stretch my neck muscles, I also checked it on my mother who also has a problem with r-cpd (after all, I must have this dysfunction and this drinking habit from someone) and it turned out that my mother also drinks this way (sucking on the bottle)
I've been drinking for a few days without sucking the bottle and every time I feel a huge stretch in my neck, but most people drink normally and I've never heard of "pain, neck stretching when drinking normally" wtf

I'm sorry for my English but I only know it enough to enable basic communication on the street

I guess that many sentences are incoherent here, so if there are more people with r-cpd who also drink by sucking the bottle and feel the stretching in a normal way, I would like to ask a Polish person who knows English well to write me a dm, elaborate on the topic and translate it well

I don't mean strictly about sucking, but about drinking in such a way that the bottle crumples, I think it has something to do with r-cpd that when drinking from the bottle without covering the entire spout of the bottle, my neck stretches much more, and the definition of r-cpd it is the lack of relaxation of the muscle responsible for burping, perhaps this is some reason for this dysfunction, but these are just my observations from my experience and that of my mother

maybe there is a problem here? We have been drinking since the existence of the population, it is an activity we do a dozen times a day, in the past people only drank from bottles (tree bark, glass), straws were not common, maybe because you never tilted your head significantly while drinking, you did not activate your neck muscles and the burping muscle is not stretched, when you finally have to drink from the bottle do you feel a stretch in your neck?

I have not used botox, I have been doing shaker exercises for some time, hoping that the muscle will start working, I get rid of the symptoms by vomiting air, putting 2 places into my throat but to empty most of the air I have to do it 10-20 times, how to prolong a forced burp to get rid of it air in a few seconds in a few movements?

I remember my first symptoms when I was 7-8 years old, on a school trip during a long walk, now I'm 16 and since I've been going to the gym for almost a year and gaining weight, the symptoms have intensified by about 30% (probably due to the positive caloric balance and eating more) I started running a month ago, then the symptoms worsened literally 5 times and after the last meal I couldn't get up from the chair and go to brush my teeth, I just went to bed and lay there for 2 hours until the air in my stomach calmed down, then I came across this problem. group and at the same time I got sick, so I stayed at home for 8 days and as I later found out, rcpd gets much worse when I'm sick, I don't know if all this intensification is just having it in my head, some placebo, or the running and the sickness that's some influence I wrote to Lucy and have been waiting for a reply for 27 hours So far, I have been doing shaker exercises for over 2 weeks, stretching my neck and trying to eat standing or sitting without tilting my head.

As far as I know, Lucy from the UK does this procedure by simply inserting a needle into the neck from the outside, without any tests or devices other than sticking some sensor on the outside of the chest. so the conclusion is that there are a few different ways to perform this procedure and each one works differently, some will charge €20k for unnecessary anesthesia, a hospital stay and a lot of tests, and some will charge the price of Botox, a needle and probably some fees for having an office in the hospital

Title    : Botox at Charite Berlin - My experience (Germany)
Selftext :
Hey fellas,

as promised, my post about a week after my Botox in Berlin.

​

Situation Pre-Botox:  


Often bloated, gurgles, only been able to burp a pathetic face-fart every other month, overall horrible feeling every day, all day. And farts. The Farts. You know about it. You'll be farting all day. You know it, I don't need to talk too much about it.

​

Making the appointment:

I called in at Charite Berlin, wrote them a mail, got into first contact, it took a few days to reach someone as theyre pretty busy as it seems. Once they called back after 1-2 days, I had a very friendly person giving me an appointment for diagnosis and also one for operation.

​

Diagnosis:

They poked a long metal-rod-camera down my throat which wasn't halfway bad, checked my throat, had me do a few sounds and yeah... I got my diagnosis. Honestly, couldve one that over the phone, but who cares, I got my appointment for the operation and headed back home.

​

The procedure:

I arrived at like 7 am (monday) at the hospital, got into narcosis at like 8:30 am and the operation took overall like 60 minutes by what I heard. 50 Units of Botox, no complications. No pain, nothing bad. NOTHING to fear about this operation. You didn't even notice you had one afterwards.

Afterwards I felt nothing bad, swallowing was normal, no burping for the first days, but it takes a bit to get started,  you know.

​

After the procedure:

I ended up in a hospital room for the "audiologie and phoniatrie" (Which is the throat-department of charite) with another really nice no-burper and we spent 2 days there together. My neighbour already started burping on tuesday evening like a complete mad person, while nothing for me happened so far, only little gurgles which didn't go back down but instead went "out". So basically a gas-release.

Felt pretty "tiny" compared to my roommates massive burps, but hey, progress. 

Afterwards on wednesday we both traveled home and on thursday (day 4) the burping really started off for me. I had (and still have) to tilt my head sideways in order to get burps out, but i can burp controlled now. The burps are coming out, I can finally burp.

Swallowing foods with texture like bread, pizza and meat is a bit complicated, I always need some liquid with it, but it's not too bad. There is also no acid reflux so far on day 7, but I'm shooting massive burps out and I couldn't be happier.

​

Charite Berlin gets a solid 10/10 from me, procedure was great, cost was basically 0 except for travel, the food in the hospital was actually really good and everything was nice.

Also a shoutout to my nice roommate :) 

​

Cost:

So I traveled there twice by ICE (fast-travel trains in germany) taking \~5 hours per drive, costing about 90€ per ride. So overall I paid 360€ for travel, couldve went cheaper, but I chose the comfort over the price. Also i planned a bit badly, so I had to book a hotel for 180€ for 3 nights total, but that's also not too bad as I got a bit through berlin, it was like a little vacation.

The procedure itself was free. German health insurance hell yeah. I paid 5€ per night in the hospital, but that's... more than good.

Overall, for the procedure at charite, with german health insurance, you will pay around 10-20€ for the stay in the hospital. Traveling and everything else not accounted for.

Dont be underwhelmed. I had it 3 weeks ago, didnt burp the first 4 days.
In the first 2 weeks, tilting my head heavily or turning it heavily (not that it hurts, just far) helped burps come out. But that takes a few days.

After like 3 weeks now, yesterday I learned to do normal-headed-burps so my work-buddys cant bully me anymore Hahahah

It takes 10-14 days for the botox to take effect.

So after 3-4 days expect the first noticeable stuff, maybe after 2 days micromicroburps. But it will come, be patient.

Hey, going great.
The minivomits are over and the botox worked well. No more bloating, still like 50% more burps than a normal person but it's great!
The swallowing issue is nearly gone. It's a bit weird, but no big deal.
The "doctor" was audiologie and phoniatrie in Charite in Berlin. They have an entire department specializes on noburp and similar.
The first call (audio, no videocalls) to the operation date was under 2 months.

Overall solid 9/10 with my bad planning of hotel booking and travel 😂

Title    : Think I have RCPD, advice pls
Selftext :
I've literally burped one time in my life, it just like dosnt happen to me. When I feel like I need to I can feel the air come up but then there's just a gurgle n it dissapears then comes back n keeps happening. For context i do have emetophobia and have done my entire life (it's pretty severe rn has been for the past month, will always get bad every now n then) i get nausea all the time but just put it down to anxiety and stress. Never considered it could be this until now. I also get pretty bad bloating and usually no matter what I've ate during the day I look huge every night (I always worry about my weight so ts really gets to me)
I don't even know how I could go about getting diagnosed (potentially) and treatment. I just asked my mum n she was like "what so you never burp after a meal? Or after a fizzy drink?" And I'm like "girl no I didn't know it was normal not to burp after meals n stuff" like I didn't know. 
What should I do cuz I really wana sort this out and feel like this genuinely could be the reason for always feeling like shit

Title    : camera in throat update pt2 :3
Selftext :
obviously the whole reason why I got this is bc I can't burp but on my report my throat is normal like completely normal. it even said my health is great which is a surprise, it only came back with gastritis which kinda makes sense but also not really because how does that link to not being able to burp? it also mentioned acid reflux but how can I have gastritis and acid reflux for the past like 20 years n just never have known? having R-CPD still sounds like right to me idk if I'm just being crazy atp.
also the trapped gas and throat pain since the camera thing has been awful there's not much I can do abt it either bc I CANT BURP 😭
they put me on Sucralfate 1g tablets twice a day and Ursodeoxycholic acid 250mg once a day for it  n my mum said ill get better. yeah it'll be great if the gastritis and reflux stops but like I still can't burp n since finding out that it's not normal it's just been pissing me off 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'll probably have to have a review with my GP after afew weeks so I'm still gna keep telling them that I still can't burp n ill just have to see what happens ig

Title    : After 33 Years, I Finally Feel Seen
Selftext :
My whole life, I've been unable to burp. I get these crushing pains in my chest that feel similar to what I'd imagine a heart attack might feel like. 

I'm unable to release the trapped air, and the pain has woken me from a sound sleep numerous times. 

My only recourse has been to essentially make myself gag, and it forces an insane sounding, earth shattering belch out, but it is just so uncomfortable and so embarrassing. 

I saw a gastroenterologist a few years ago, about 2018, and described the feeling and he told me he's never heard of that, and almost made me feel... over dramatic? 

Anyway, it's the strangest feeling knowing there are more of us out there and at least someone can empathize.

Title    : Questions
Selftext :
Because I just found this sub and other people like me, I have some questions I have always wondered about. 

1. Does anyone else have a hard time with stuff like French fries or hash browns? When I eat them, it's like a 50/50 chance, it'll get stuck and I get these painful, deep hiccups that eventually bring the potatoes back up. No one else I've ever asked have heard of this. 

2. What does it feel like to you when air gets stuck? For me, it's a crushing pain in my chest that makes it hard to get a deep breath. It almost feels like my ribs could break from the inside out. 

3. Do you have a hard time vomiting? I always assumed it was over dramatized when in movies, a character will poke themselves in the throat once and vomit. Not to be too graphic, but I've had to make myself before and it was many, many times I had to force the reflex, not once. 

Thank you for any information. I've always felt like an island, with no one else who've ever experienced this, so it's refreshing to see others with the same problem.

Title    : Anyone else have trouble taking medicine?
Selftext :
I swear I have to like, psych myself up to swallow a pill. I have it in my mouth, but I basically have to force myself to actually take it. It's like my body physically doesn't want to swallow. 

Then 80% of the time, it gets stuck halfway down and I have painful hiccups for the next half hour, so I guess I understand my subconscious hesitation. 

Anyone else have similar problems?

Title    : Need to Vent
Selftext :
I'm on antibiotics for a sinus infection. Huge, difficult to swallow pills. I break them in half and they still get stuck. 

I asked for a liquid and they didn't accommodate that, so I'm kinda just stuck with the pills this time. 

Anyway, today I go to take my morning dose and the first half goes down okay. I take the second half, it's stuck and I can't wash it down with the OJ I'm drinking, but I try. 

Suddenly, a loud, painful hiccup sends orange juice out my nose and the pill finally goes down. 

Now my nose burns, I'm embarrassed, it's uncomfortable. And all I wanted to do was take my medicine. 

Just needed to vent to someone who'd understand or has been there a time or two. I know a lot of us tend to be so used to our symptoms that we don't complain a lot, but damn if this whole thing isn't just plain uncomfortable. 

It hurts, it's embarrassing, it can be quite scary, and I'm having a much worse day with it today than I usually do.

I was told by a gastro that I was subconsciously avoiding burping because I knew, deep down, that it was unladylike and didn't want to have bad manners. 

One day I'm scrolling reddit and some random, completely unrelated sub had a post and someone commented and tagged this sub. 

Saw a doctor, got a diagnosis, awaiting botox.

Title    : Hypersalivation help!!!
Selftext :
So I just discovered this group and am beyond excited that I’m not crazy!!! Doctors and friends and families would always look at me like I had five heads when I said I couldn’t burp. 

So I have a cold currently and have been mouth breathing causing a lot of gas to build up in my sternum area. I keep just getting sharp pains and then gurgling but sometimes I’ll get the pain and then start salivating like crazy for like 30 seconds and I have to keep swallowing over and over. It doesn’t taste acidic but almost salty? Has anyone experienced this?

I finally got an appt with a doctor in Boston who is familiar with the no burp phenomenon. I explained everything and he did a voice box test to make sure all looked good and it did.

Title    : How to relieve gas pain after drinking?
Selftext :
So I’ve known I can’t burp and have been good about staying away from things that might make me bloated but I’ve noticed whenever I drink alcohol, pretty much anything but especially carbonated, I get super bad gurgles and like a tight chest and feel like I’m going to dry heave and get like a thick saliva. I really don’t want to get Botox or anything since this is the only thing that makes it flare up so does anyone have any tips or tricks to help? The only thing that helps is laying down which I obviously can’t do if I’m out! I might try taking tums or an antacid before drinking next time I do which is only like once a month. I know it’s silly and I could just not drink but I’d like to have a few drinks with my friends occasionally without feeling like I have to dry heave😅

Selftext :
so I'm 17 and I havent been able to burp my whole life (except as a baby) sometimes I'll burp like once a year but i dont mean to, I dont usually have bloating but sometimes when I do gurgle I will get chest pain what lasts a few seconds then goes away n then I feel fine, does anyone else get this? I dont think its acid reflux as when I never gurgle I never get these chest pains, these chest pains dont happen every time I gurgle but do happen sometimes when I do gurgle, it is annoying as it is uncomfortable, but I would love to know if this is dangerous or just something what is very annoying? and another question how do you lot deal with the gurgles if you are at college or work cos I usually relief mine at home when I lie down but I dont know what to do when I'm at college

acid reflux can be a symptom of not being able to burp, there are some exercises you can do which are meant to relax your UES and some people have been able to burp from doing it:

cricoid massage
shaker exercise

also some people air vomit or kinda of like beat the throat to try and force air out but I dont do this. 

everyone has their own symptoms for this, we've just got to live on I'm afraid unless you get treatment. try the shaker exercise and see how it goes and keep trying it cos you never know it could work :)

Title    : Which specialist did you see?
Selftext :
I have finally gone to see my doctor to get a referral. Of course he had no idea of what RCPD is, so he gave me a referral to both an ENT and a gastroenterologist. 
I have called both places, and asked if my condition/symptoms sound familiar to what they do there, and both receptionists didn't know but told me to book in anyway. 
Of course I don't want to waste money, so please tell me which specialist you saw to help! 
I'm in Melbourne, Australia so we don't have that fantastic doctor that is mentioned here often.

Title    : Question for people post botox 
Selftext :
Hi! 

I am booked in for the botox procedure on the 3rd of Feb. However, I am getting married on the 15th of Feb, and leaving for our honeymoon the next day. 
I was wondering, since it's 2 days shy of 2 weeks, is the 3rd of Feb too close? I obviously don't want to have trouble swallowing at my wedding. Not sure about the recovery. 
This is my first procedure, so it will be the initial amount of units. I saw Dr Paddle in Melbourne if it makes a difference! 

Thank you so much!

I can eat a fair amount of food. I absolutely love food. I was also diagnosed with RCPD by my ENT and getting botox for it in 2 weeks. I do feel extreme discomfort after eating big meals and can't enjoy dinners out because I need to lie down. So people can have RCPD and eat full meals. Just because your experience is different, doesn't make the other hand untrue.

Title    : I'm certain I have R-CPD and not sure if surgery will fix it
Selftext :
Hello everyone. I have just discovered this community today, and I thought I was only one of a few that cannot burp. My symptoms are:

* Constant feeling of air stuck in throat
* Can hear noises of air going up my throat
* I can only remember burping once by accident in my entire life
* Hiccups while I'm sleeping and sometimes painful Hiccups
* Get bloated very easily
* Horse voice at times
* Acid reflux at times
* Chest feels very tight when I swim in a pool

I have recently had a Gastroscopy done and the Doctor found that I have a proximal esophageal stricture and a small Hiatus Hernia.

My question is if I were to get these two things fixed would it fix my no burping problem? 

Thanks for anyone's help :)

When I get hiccups in the day I can often hold my breath after the first hiccup and they will go away. If I drink soft drink or sugary drinks I can get painful hiccups so I avoid that. I often hiccup in my sleep as well. Once I was hiccuping in my sleep and a pillow was randomly thrown at me, I wasn't expecting that and the hiccups went away.

Do you drink any alcohol or sugary drinks? Have you seen a doctor about it?

I believe that my hiccups is my body trying to burp.

Please let us know how you go over the next coming weeks. I've been doing Shaker exercises on and off for while now and no luck. I'm glad it's helped you and I'm glad you were able to save the money.

Could you please go into more detail about your exercises? How long did you lift your chin up to your chest for? How many reps did you do of this? When you were doing it while walking, did you look down normally or tightly?

I lay flat on the bed and lift my head to my chest for 60sec, 60sec rest, 3 reps. Then do that again but hold for 1sec, 30 reps.

It sounds like you may have a minor case, R-CPD seems to effect everyone in different ways. You are lucky that it doesn't seem to bother you that much. If your symptoms get any worse or it starts to bother you in the future, you should think about getting the treatment.

If the distance is too far then send an email or call the ENT's in your area and ask if they treat R-CPD. If you can attend the specialist with mum she may realize that this problem is more serious then what she thinks. I hope your son can get the treatment sooner rather then later.

Hey everyone, I know I have R-CPD because I've got most of the symptoms my whole life. But recently I've had this dizziness feeling that would last for about a second and then go away, it's been happening often over the last few days. I used to get this feeling after a very long day at work but now it seems to be happening even when I'm at home. I'm hoping that this will get better in a few days.

I only get very painful hiccups if I drink softdrink, which I haven't done for years. But I do often get hiccups while I'm asleep, they can be uncomfortable but I can tolerate it. I also randomly get hiccups during the day but I can often stop them after the first one.

The way I stop them after the first hiccup during the day is I breathe in as much as I can and hold my breath for a while. After this don't cough for a while otherwise the hiccups will return and you won't be able to get rid of them. I'm not sure if this would work for anyone else but it works for me.

If it is bothering you I would see a doctor that is known to treat R-CPD on the Wiki. Botox has been described as "Training wheels" to learn how to burp again. You may just need to get that treatment to start burping normal again.

Appointment on Tuesday and Botox on Wednesday, I can't believe how quickly things happen at BVI! How long did you have to wait to book the appointments?

I'm in Australia, and I had to wait a month for an MBS test, then another week to see the specialist (Which is tomorrow), then when I see them I guess I'll find out the date and cost of the Botox.

I wish you all the best and I hope it will be one and done for you.

Title    : Got Botox today! 22/09/2002
Selftext :
This morning I got 75 units of Botox, and a balloon dilation in my esophagus. 

I know it's very early days for me yet, but at this stage my R-CPD is exactly the same, but with the additional common problem of needing to sip water after every swallow. I've also had the hiccups for about 30min (some painful but most not). I can usually get rid of hiccups after the first one but not today.

When did everyone start burping post Botox? Did anyone else also get hiccups post Botox? Hopefully in the coming days/weeks I'll be able to do these burps and not have to deal with R-CPD again.

I've tried turning my head to the right and left when I feel the first few coming up and I can definitely feel a difference, but it also feels like I'm going to choke.

Title    : I am starting to Micro Burp! Day 4 of Botox. My method on how to Micro Burp
Selftext :
Tonight I have started to Micro Burp! I am on Day 4 of Botox. I discovered something, I was experimenting with different throat movements and I have found that:

I turn my head to the right, and lift up the Uvula area using my throat/neck muscles, open my mouth as wide as I can, then when my head is to the right I point it downwards then I can sometimes do a Micro Burp, sometimes I can taste them as well. It only happens when I do these things at this stage.

If you have had the Botox and are struggling to burp consider giving this a try, it may or may not work for you but I hope this can help someone.

**Update:** Day 10. I have now found an additional step, after doing my method above I will slowly breathe out, once I have breathed out as much as I can sometimes a rush of air will come up and I will burp it out. But keep in mind this only works sometimes and only when I feel I need to burp, sometimes when I get that big rush of air my UES will close or I will only get a little burp and most of the air will go back down.

Also, sometimes when I yawn a burp will just naturally come out without having to do anything.

Title    : Does anyone get hiccups in the middle of a slow swallow post Botox?
Selftext :
I'm 2 weeks post Botox and I have the common slow swallowing side effect. A thing I've noticed is when I swallow something solid and if I don't sip water fast enough to push it down I will get the hiccups, then after I sip the water the hiccups usually go away. Does anyone else have this?

I think my body is just confused in the middle of the swallow and thinks the food is stuck so it tries to push the food up by hiccuping. After I fully complete the swallow and meal with water a few minutes later I usually start to do a few burps that I can taste when I turn my head to the right.

Title    : Practiced with a carbonated beverage and vomited a little bit.
Selftext :
Last night I decided it was time for me to practice with a carbonated beverage. Things were going quite well, I was doing decent burps about 50% of the time after dinner and then a few hours later I tried drinking the carbonated beverage, 30 minutes after that I went to do a burp and then I ended up vomiting a little bit in my mouth. But it felt so different from when I used to vomit, vomiting used to be a real struggle for me due to lifelong R-CPD so it felt so weird that it just came out automatically.

Since I wasn't feeling full that night due to burping out the bloat, I think this made me feel more hungry then usual leading me to eat too much and the carbonated beverage was the icing on the cake haha!

Has anyone else accidentally vomited in their mouth while doing a normal burp?

Now 4 months later post Botox, I can go in the pool without any R-CPD symptoms! I will now do lots of little burps that relieve me and I can breathe properly. I'm not as good as someone who was born with the ability to burp but I'm grateful for the relief I get.

No regrets. Before Botox, I used to be grossed out by hearing other people burping as well. After Botox, I did taste my burps for a while but 4 months later it's not as noticeable. If you are worried about the taste try to eat something refreshing like your favorite fruit.

Sometimes I do regurgitate, but I think the reason for that is I've had R-CPD for 30+ years, I feel this has caused weakness to my LES.

I still drink a glass of soda water everyday to practice doing decent burps.

In my opinion the procedure was well worth it.

Title    : Short Gurgles vs Long Gurgles Anyone Have An Explanation?
Selftext :
As someone who cannot belch, I tend to have the gurgles usually all day starting around noon and lasting until I fall asleep at night. Some gurgles can be short and some gurgles can be a lot longer and louder. They are constantly frequent, and usually don't even stop until the next morning. I'm looking for an explanation, if anyone knows why there's such a massive difference I would love to know why.

​

However, sometimes tums do relive the gurgling. Does anyone have an explanation on that too?

Hi everyone, I am similar to everyone in this group, I cannot burp. I have horrible stomach aches and am fed up with all of it. I’m wondering about some of the details of the Botox procedure, specifically the one taken place near Chicago.

What’s the average cost for this procedure? Did anyone have the luck of insurance covering part of it?

How many days after the procedure does the sore throat/trouble swallowing last?

Is it worth it? What symptoms did it fix for you?
Thanks!

Hi everyone, so long story short I’ve been a no burper my whole life and use to gurgles. However I am under the weather now and now my gurgles really hurt.

Title    : How does everyone get rid of gurgles?
Selftext :
Gurgling never really had an affect on my mental health until I recently vomited. I’m someone with some pretty major emetophobia. Since then my anxiety has spiked. It usually gets worse as the day goes on as I can’t burp to let out any normal amount of built up gas which leads to nausea. Then when I gurgle that starts to set my anxiety on high alert. My solution (if possible) is to lay flat on my back with a heating pad for hours on end. Anyone else have any advice?

I was just coming here to ask the same question! In the last couple months I’ve experience a huge increase in the gurgles and don’t know why. I am not a huge soda drinker and haven’t changed my dairy or veggie intake.

Has anyone ever experienced adderall (prescribed) increasing the gurgles? The gurgles got worse about the time I started my prescription.

I’ve also been drinking a lot more coffee and getting less sleep. Any insight you’ve got will be amazing! I need help bc it’s becoming really painful and distracting and it will be months I can get an appointment to talk about the Botox treatment. Thanks, fellow lizard sound makers!

I completely know that feeling but I assure you (form my own experience, not medical expertise) it is unlikely a pill. Many times I’ve had a form of acid reflux that feels exactly like a pill or piece of food is stuck at the bottom of of my esophagus. Turns out that while it’s not the actual pill, swallowing the pill can allow a bit of acid up, irritating the esophagus in a way that makes it feel like the pill is still there. If you aren’t having breathing problems, I would wait it out!

Title    : Any suggestions for non acidic/non-gurgle inducing caffeine sources??
Selftext :
I have always had the gurgles and also always loved coffee with mild digestive annoyance but recently coffee causes MAJOR gurgles and pain. So do those caffeinated Celsius brand drinks and Diet Coke. Any suggestion for caffeine sources that don’t irritate us no burpers? I would prefer something that tastes good (like coffee or Celsius) and to avoid energy drinks if possible. I would even take suggestions of certain types of coffee that are less irritating!! 🙏☕️

I appreciate the advice but it’s unfortunately not due to gulping. I usually drink iced coffee through a straw over several hours, so I think it is either caused by the caffeine itself, or (more likely) the acidity from caffeinated beverages.

I totally understand that feeling but you *definitely* shouldn’t do it more often. Our bodies hate throwing up for a reason. Not only is it bad nutritionally, as you lose all the fluids and nutrients you’ve ingested, but the acid can damaged your throat and teeth and doing it too frequently can alter your gag reflex permanently. Not to mention it has the possibility of leading to an eating disorder. 

I would recommend maybe trying the air vomit (it’s not real puking) strategy on the noburp website to release some of your air.

Title    : Need solidarity: My shortness of breath (dyspnea) and fatigue after eating has been really horrible. Does anyone else experience this and have you noticed what makes it worse for you? Any suggestions to relieve it?
Selftext :
I know you many of you all can relate so free to comment and just commiserate. I feel so alone in this because no one else I know feels this kind of fatigued after eating.

Recently almost every time I eat I find myself absolutely exhausted and weak, usually accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. It feels like even moderate movement is too much and I find myself unable to take in enough air. I’m finding it so limiting and disruptive in my life. 

I was hoping it was an intolerance so I could just avoid the food but I have been struggling to tie it to a specific food or time of day. I recently recovered from COVID as well and wonder if this could have something to do with the increased shortness of breath? I also take Adderall for ADHD and find that that can cause heart racing so I wonder if it can affect my breathing as well. 

How common is this for you guys? Has anyone ever spoken to a Dr about this and if so, how did they respond? I worry they’ll be dismissive.

What do you do to reduce this symptom or mitigate its effect on your daily life? Is limiting my actual meals (vs small snacks) to evening before bed the only way to keep this fatigue from interfering with my daily life?

Selftext :
I’ve been noticing that every time I drink I’m in pain for the next few hours until I go to bed. It’s like a painful need to release the air and then the gurgles are super painful and annoying when they happen. Literally two sips of alcohol will do this. 

I usually drink wine or some sort of basic cocktail and they both make it worse. I assume it’s acid related but for social reasons I don’t want to give up drinking entirely. Have y’all noticed any drinks that don’t cause this type of reaction?

I almost constantly and compulsively have to scrunch up my chest and abdomen and like clench my abs/torso muscles to try to push the gurgle air out. It’s so overwhelmingly painful and exhausting and distracting.

Title    : How soon can I fly post-Botox? Need help planning my travel after the procedure!
Selftext :
I’m getting the Botox procedure in month (FINALLY) but the procedure will be out of state. Usually it’s 2 short flights (one layover) usually like 4-6 hours total including both flights and layover. My parents live a few hours from the clinic where I’ll be getting the Botox.

Ideally, I’d fly into the city the clinic is in spend the night (Tuesday)  in a hotel, Uber to the hospital, Uber from the hospital and fly back to my current city the same day as the procedure (Wednesday.) (If necessary, I could probably afford a second night in a hotel but it’d be unideal.)

My other option is to fly into my parents city, drive 4-5hrs with one of them to the clinic, get the procedure and sleep the 4-5hr drive back to their house. If I did this, I could probably stay from Wednesday (procedure day) to Sunday before returning to my place. 

**How bad did you feel immediately after the procedure? Is a 5 ish hour travel day (either flights or car) doable the day of the procedure at all??**

It would be way easier for me to do the flights and not drive to and from my parents, but I’m worried that will be too painful…

She definitely has R-CPD. If she’s uncomfortable with the symptoms, definitely take her to an ENT who is familiar with the condition.

Temporarily cutting out dairy could still be a good idea as it gives you insight into any other digestive conditions she has. She could definitely be lactose intolerant in addition to having R-CPD (like me), but lactose intolerance usually presents as diarrhea and flatulence. There are some other dairy intolerances that could be identified if she eliminated dairy from her diet for a short period.

Hey just chiming in to say that I totally relate and I have the exact same problem as OP, but the link posted above does not at all support what FasterFester said.

I did! My insurance was Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and they denied it because it wasn’t “medically necessary”. I believe the use of Botox sets off warning bells, making them think it’s cosmetic (which is stupid, because obviously Botox is used for other things).

My doctor sent them a letter and some scientific articles about the legitimacy of the procedure. I also wrote a letter about my own personal experience and need for the procedure and my Dr added it to the documents they sent.

The appeal got approved about 6 weeks after we sent in the appeal documents and now my Botox is scheduled for July! WOOHOO!

If you attempt this and it doesn’t go through, you’re legally allowed to request a hearing with a third party to make the decision. Basically a doctor that is not affiliated with you or the insurance company reads all the documents and listens to both sides and then makes a decision.

Title    : Just realized how many women in history probably had R-CPD and had to wear CORSETS?? Ouch 
Selftext :
While watching Bridgerton this week, I started thinking about how horrible it must have been to wear a corset (or any of the many restrictive clothing items women have had to wear throughout history) while dealing with the bloating and dyspnea and gurgling of R-CPD.

There are so many days that I struggle with normal bras or tight tank tops or pants with elastic-y waists. I genuinely can’t imagine breathing or moving or eating in a boned corset!!

I’m absolutely in the same boat here. I’m 25 and my symptoms because much worse around exactly the same age. I also found that ADHD medication makes my symptoms SO much worse. 

I’ve recently been attempting to switch meds because adderall made my R-CPD symptoms almost incapacitating some days. I’ve been trying Mydayis so far and I think it is somewhat better, though my dose is kinda low. 

Stimulants also sometimes get me stuck in a weird compulsive cycle of tensing my ab and chest muscles repetitively, like I’m trying to force the gurgles up and out of my throat. I definitely do that tensing thing at other times, but I find it becomes so compulsive and almost uncontrollable when I’m very anxious or taking my stimulant medication.

I don’t have many tips but I’ve noticed a couple things always make it worse, so maybe try avoiding these?:
1. Talking while eating or drinking makes me swallow more air
2. Eating quickly with minimal chewing also makes me swallow more air. Even when I’m starving I try really hard to eat a single bite at a time and then put my fork down to chew and swallow so I’m not shoveling it into my mouth lmao
3. Drinking with a straw
4. Drinking carbonated beverages
5. Consuming caffeine and stimulants can make the chest tightness worse 

Eating 5-7 small meals a day, vs 3 normal meals, definitely keeps the symptoms more manageable. Laying down and/or taking a bath after eating really helps.

In terms of nausea, I’ve found that those Nauzene chewables and Emetrol liquid medicines can help.

Dr. Mortensen-Welch in Albany is amazing. She’s done more than 60 Botox injections (75 units, under anesthesia) and has a 90% success rate with just one injection. I live a few hours away so I spent the night in Albany after the procedure and it was super easy. Since Boston is less than 3 hours away, you could probably just go in for the procedure and then straight home. 

Were your failed treatments done in office or under anesthesia? Do you know how many units they used? I know there is also an option to make a slight incision in the muscle if Botox doesn’t work.

Title    : PLEASE participate in this poll about the onset of burps after Botox! 🫧
Selftext :
I’ve noticed many recent posts from people who’ve recently gotten the Botox procedure and are concerned that they are not burping within a specific timeframe. I am hoping that this poll could help answer some of those questions.

I’ve been looking through old posts and Dr. Bastian’s articles and it seems like the vast majority of people gain the ability to burp within 48 hours, but many people on here seemed not have experienced a slightly different timeline. I got Botox 4 days ago and, though I have slight slow swallow symptoms, I still haven’t burped.

I think it’d be interesting to gain a broader perspective of burp timing post Botox.

Please answer the poll below, referring to when you first started burping, including any microburps! Feel free to leave comments with more information about your timing OR with any suggestions for how to make yourself burp post Botox.

Thank you for sharing this! Do microburps feel and taste like very tiny burps? Or is it more like a gurgle bubble that gets released with no taste? (I have a small burp like once or twice a year so I vaguely l ow how they might feel but I’m not sure what to expect from microburps.)

Thanks again for your encouragement. I so hope I’ll feel that relief soon!

Title    : How long did you wait for a second round of Botox?
Selftext :
So I’m not sure yet if I’ll need a second round of Botox but it’s looking like I might and I wanted to ask questions here before I talked to my doctor. For insurance reasons (yay USA) it’d be a lot better for me to do the second round like 2 months after the first one. 

**How long after your first round of Botox can you get the second one?** *Do you need to wait the full 3-6 months for the first Botox to wear off, or can you do it like a month or two later?*

**Is the second round of Botox always more units than the first round?** 

***If you’ve gotten a second round, do you mind sharing the timeline, the dosage for both rounds, the results of the first injection, and then the final outcome?***

So far I’m barely 2 weeks past my first dose but I haven’t burped *at all*, so it’s less about it wearing off and more that it just hasn’t fixed anything yet.  

And yeah, you’re right. I’m also moving states soon and switching insurances at the end of October and I don’t think there are any doctors who do the Botox procedure under GA within network for my new insurance. I’d much rather stay with the same doctor who did my first injection and is super wonderful.

Title    : Advice needed: How to ask my Dr to do my second Botox injection at 2 months?
Selftext :
For people who’ve had a second Botox injection from Dr. Bastian, how ling did you have to wait after your first? Please feel free to answer if you did it with another doctor too! Share timeline and the doctor’s name if possible!

My doctor said that she waits 3 months for the first Botox injection to wear off before administering a second dose. However, I’ve definitely seen other people on here who got their second dose less than 2 months after their first and I assume it’s safe. I also wonder if there’s potential for the Botox to have compounding effects and maybe it would boast the efficacy of the second dose?

I have to switch to a new insurance 2 months after my first (likely failed) dose, and I’m concerned that the new plan won’t cover this procedure. Therefore, I’d much prefer to get the second dose slightly sooner but I need advice on speaking to my doctor about it.

Does anyone know of any relevant studies (R-CPD specific, or not) that would provide more information about the benefits or risks of doing two injections within two months?

Selftext :
I got my first injection ~2 weeks ago from a doctor in NY, not the Bastian Voice Institute, and I haven’t had any microburps or burps. 

My doctor said they usually schedule the second injection for 3 months after the first. However, my insurance will be changing before the 3 months is up and my new one will not cover this doctor (uncertain if it will cover the procedure). 

I’d like to combine my doctor to do my second Botox 6-8 weeks after my first, but I’d like to have some evidence to back up my request to expedite the timeline. 

**What is Bastian’s (or any other doctor tbh) normal timeline for another injection?** I’ve seen other people on this sub get the second injection within 5 months of their first.

Title    : Is shortness of breath the worst symptom for anyone else? Nearly crying from frustration and I need someone who related 
Selftext :
I experience nearly all of the R-CPD symptoms but I think that dyspnea (shortness of breath) is the absolute worst one. I just need to know that others feel, or felt, this too 💔

It feels so overwhelming and impossible to explain to anyone else how painful and deeply exhausting it is to be near constantly struggling to breathe. I never realized how unbelievably important it is to feel capable of taking a full breath 

It contributes to such a deeply physical feeling of panic, even when my environment/life doesn’t require panic. There are some nights where I take a Benadryl or an edible to force myself to sleep before dinner because it is the ONLY thing that relives the panic and the dyspnea. 

So tired of this (physically, emotionally), I can’t even articulate it. I’m so fucking beyond “frustrated”, I wish there was a word that meant “deeply exhausted, furious, panicky, physically in pain, exasperated, heartbroken, envious(of those without this), emotionally done”.

I don’t find that air vomiting helps because the air doesn’t feel as high up in my throat as it does when I have intense gurgle. Please let me know if you have other suggestions! I know my oxygen saturation remains normal and >95%, but it still feels unbelievably difficult to get a good breath. 

Not sure what I’m asking  for here, other than wanting others to commiserate with. I miss living like normal (in addition to being active and taking walks without feeling horrible and being ABLE TO BREATHE”.

*FYI, I did get Botox 2 weeks ago but it hasn’t caused a single burp. I’m working with my dr to schedule a second injection but I’m honestly still angry (not at the doctor at all! just upset in general) and devastated that the first didn’t work. *

After my first injection I got a bit of slow swallow and louder gurgles but I still unable to burp. I’m working on scheduling a second one for the winter but I’m scared it’s not going to work.

I’m concerned that I’m a weird case that just won’t get relief from Botox for some reasons. I know it’s not really reasonable to make that jump after only one failed procedure but it’s discouraging!

That’s a super common side effect of the drugs they give you for anesthesia. I knew I frequently get nauseous so for my Botox, I told them ahead of time and they gave me medication to prevent that. Make sure you request that for yourself next time.

The throwing up is annoying AF but there is no way that it will negatively affect the Botox. There just isn’t a biological mechanism for it. 

However, it’s possible it may actually encourage your burps! Some people actually learn to burp from frequent air vomiting and this is a similar concept. Basically while you’re vomiting, your cricopharyngeal sphincter is opening up in the same way it needs to when you burp which might be good practice for your future post-Botox burping! 

I hope the nausea goes away soon. But it’s really great it cured your emetophobia

Swallowing dysfunctions only increase aspiration pneumonia as far as I know. That’s when you get pneumonia from food entering your lungs. It’s very different from the pneumonia most people think of. Is that what you had?

Even if it was, it seems unlikely that R-CPD would increase the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia since our cricopharyngeal sphincter is tighter on the way up (the “retrograde party” and doesn’t typically affect swallowing. I suppose it may be possible for it to happen post Botox but it that case, it’s not really caused by R-CPD.

As far as I know, if you can’t burp then you DO have R-CPD, because it’s really the only diagnostic criteria.

I second pokerxii’s disclaimer about the doctors. If they’re not an ENT listed in the map of known R-CPD providers, they most likely won’t know about this condition or be able to help. Hopefully one day we can expect all doctors to know about it, but today is definitely not that day 😓

I get why you’d be annoyed by her acting like that. Though I think doctors still know so little about this so it might have been genuine surprise. And honestly, I think it might be more common for people to never burp or for the burping to wear off post-Botox than Bastien’s original study showed.

I have Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and I successfully appealed!

I was initially denied because the procedure was deemed not “medically necessary”. My doctor said that insurance companies sometimes deny procedures that require Botox automatically, since it also has cosmetic uses. She’s had other patients who’ve been denied for the R-CPD Botox and then had a successful appeal.

My doctor wrote a letter about the medical foundation and necessity of the procedure and included some of the peer-reviewed papers about RCPD and this treatment as supporting evidence. That’s part of the normal process of appealing an insurance denial. I also wrote a letter that detailed how R-CPD affects my quality of life and my health beyond the immediate no-burp symptoms (lost weight, mental health, other digestive issues). The letter from me was not required but I figured it couldn’t hurt.

I think you have a great chance of being approved after your appeal. Even if that is rejected, you are legally entitled to a second appeal that is judged by an impartial third party (doctor) who judges if the procedure is necessary.

“I wish there was a definitive test to confirm that you have RCPD rather than just getting the surgery and seeing if symptoms improve.”

As far as I know, R-CPD is very easy to diagnose. If you are unable to burp, you have R-CPD. Period. 

It’s not a disease or something that can be ruled in or out with a positive or negative test. The name of the condition is simply describing the dysfunction of a muscle in your throat. And since you can’t burp, then that muscle is dysfunctional…therefore, you have R-CPD.

People have varying symptoms and severity of discomfort, but if they can’t burp, then it’s just R-CPD.

I don’t believe I am as emetophobia as many people here but I have to say, each time after the few times I’ve thrown up, I am surprised by how anticlimactic it was. Like it’s so stressful leading up to it and it’s a horrible feeling but afterward is just such a feeling of relief. Relief because my stomach feels better and because the puking is over and I didn’t die!

I also think that it’ll be less painful and terrible post-Botox. Throwing up is so much more violent for us when our cricopharynxgeus muscle is too tight because it takes wayyy more force to get air or stomach contents past that valve. But without R-CPD, your esophagus doesn’t require as much force to get stuff up and out, so I hear it’s typically much easier. 

I am really sorry you have to worry about this though! It’s definitely going around, but hopefully with lots of handwashing you and your family will avoid it this year!🤞

Generally, Emetrol is the only over-the-counter medicine I’ve found that helps settle nausea in normal situations, though I’m not sure it’ll be able to overpower norovirus. It’s always good to have it on hand for other nauseous days though!

If you can’t burp, you have R-CPD. So you are in the right place! There’s super simple procedure to treat the condition and you can find a lot of information about it on this subreddit. 

The condition was only named a few years ago, so most doctors still haven’t heard of it and therefore can’t do the procedure. However, there is a a map of all the doctors that can treat it. We highly recommend only going to doctors on that map list, because it’s very annoying to try to reach your doctor about it.

I would consider myself cured when I stopped having the symptoms of R-CPD (major bloating, dyspnea, gurgles, etc). Which is I guess the definition of ‘cured’.

Unfortunately I’m nowhere close to that, but hopefully one day soon! How did you teach yourself to burp?

What are you asking for here? If you need names of other doctors, just search “map” in the subreddit and there will be comments with a link to a google map that lists all the known doctors that treat this. However, most of them probably have a waiting list of weeks to months.

What horror stories have you seen? I’ve been in this subreddit for years and there are almost no horror stories. Yeah sure, the Botox doesn’t always work but that’s not a horror story.

I think you should be careful about fear-mongering about this procedure that is statistically most likely to help most people here. Many people are already nervous about it, and talking about horror stories just isn’t particularly useful or accurate

If you’ve never burped then you have R-CPD, as it’s the defining criterion of this condition. Within R-CPD, there is a wide range of additional symptoms with some people experiencing nothing other than inability to burp, and other people experiencing constant discomfort and anxiety that impacts their life daily.

If you want to make an appointment with a doctor, find the google maps link (in this subreddit)with the list of all the doctors who treat this condition. It’s almost pointless to go to doctors not on the list, if you have the ability to see one on the list.

Good luck!

Title    : How to air vomit without hurting stomach/rib muscles?
Selftext :
I air vomit by putting my fingers way down my throat and kind of pulling it open. I can often get an air vomit without gagging many times before it.

However, when I do air vomit, it is accompanied by a very strong gag and my entire core clenches violently like it does when you’re about to throw up.  If I’m air vomiting several times, as I usually have to, I find the muscles under my ribs and my are extremely sore, and sometimes one hurt kind of like a minor pulled muscle. It goes away eventually but it’s often sore for a few minutes or hours.

Does this happen for everyone? If not, any suggestions for how to make air vomiting a little easier on my body  

(I’m fairly new to regularly air vomiting so maybe this will get easier and less painful the more I do it?)

If you can burp when you need to, then no, you don’t have R-CPD aka no burp.

However, I am switching to Aetna soon and I’m curious if it’ll cover it too. Especially since I know it tends to be less comprehensive coverage, Neither of the procedures worked for me unfortunately, so I’m going to apply and see if I can get a third attempt covered by Aetna

Literally the only true diagnostic criteria of R-CPD is the inability to burp. Can you burp? 

Yes? — no R-CPD for you. 
No? — you have R-CPD. 

That’s pretty much it. There are other things to talk about within the condition, like severity of symptoms and how/when the ability to burp started, but diagnosing is VERY easy.

I’ve just started experiencing symptoms, 7 days now, never had it before and I’m in my 50’s. 

But I also have gastrointestinal issues , one being acid reflux and regurgitation of food (yes not pleasant). That is part of GERD, I think.

Hi, 56 year old. Always burped, vomitted etc. but a month ago I noticed I was not burping even though I felt like it. Usually I burp and it’s from my throat.

Used to go regularly when I got up, now 2-3 days, and have to eat fiber.

I’m in my mid 50s, and about 2 months ago I found that I couldn’t burp or after some effort. Then I saw this thread and looked at all the symptoms, and I have most of them. flatulence, esp after eating, and more at night. The gurgles for sure. some bloating I think.

But here’s the thing, I can still pop out a burp, but now it comes from the chest area, before it was the throat, and I have to force it out. 

So asking if anyone got the condition this late, in my 50’s? . Assuming all the other symptoms are common?

But I have all the symptoms for sure, the flatulence, gurgling from chest area, and the burp actually although I can, it doesn’t come from the throat area. Chest instead. 

Actually which sitting here, I want to burp, but nothing. But if I force myself, especially when standing I noticed, then I can force one out. Normal burps don’t come anymore. 

I have acid reflux for many years, and I read somewhere that the muscle, can be a reaction to the reflux,

Hi, about 3 months ago I suddenly realized I couldn’t burp, the burp was stuck under my throat. I saw this community and saw all the other symptoms, which I had. My burping has come back though, although it seems to come from my chest area rather than throat. Gurgling is sporadic, but the flatulence continues, it’s unreal, after I eat. Almost, every 30 seconds . So what is this if I can burp but have some of most of the other symptoms?

I went to him and had local done in office and it didn't work. He recommended going under and having it done. The surgery center in Philly wasn't in network. They don't check to see if it is in network so you have to call your insurance to make sure it is. (DO THIS) I almost had the procedure because they said all was good and I'm very thankful that I called my insurance to double check. Anyway...... Dr. Speigal said I could have it done in Cherryhill at Jefferson by his partner Dr. Huntley. I had the procedure yesterday. Haven't burped yet.... Still trying 😔

I know it's only day 2 but I'm very scared it won't happen like the first procedure. I've been drinking carbonated beverages and really trying to burp. Lots of noises in the back of my throat like normal but nothing else. I'm so uncomfortably bloated. Any suggestions.... Idk what I'm going to do if it doesn't work. I paid over 1,800 dollars for the procedure because I had to meet my deductable and then some.

Title    : Botox Didn’t Work
Selftext :
So a couple of you asked me to update you on if my procedure worked or not. I got it done with local the first time and then the second time I was put under. When I was put under they injected Botox and also stretched the muscle. It’s been ten days. Some people are telling me to be patient and it will still happen. Has this happened to anyone and know what the next step would be? Would it be more Botox? My follow up appointment is on Monday. 😔

Today I received 100 units of Botox with local anesthesia...aka I was awake. This is my third time receiving botox. The first time I received 30 units (awake). Second time I was put under so they could also do a endoscopy (50 units) The first two times obviously didn't work. I had one single burp.... I think It was a burp.

Title    : Extreme reaction to Botox
Selftext :
I had the procedure 3 days ago with Dr. Hoesli at the Bastian Voice Institute. She was amazing and everything went well!! I am, however, perhaps over-reacting to the Botox. I burped 24 hours after the procedure and haven’t stopped. It’s quite excessive, really. I burp for anything - even bending over, drinking water, or talking normally! I even regurgitated some food so now I’m sticking to a liquid diet. It’s causing me some anxiety, especially around eating. Anyone else experience this? Did it get better and how soon?

I was super anxious about the scope as well, but it’s not nearly as bad as you think it’s going to be!! They go in through your nose so it feels like a covid test but not as bad tbh.

I’m with you - my bloating and abdominal pain was honestly debilitating. And it continued to get worse the older I got and as more time went on. Since having the procedure, I haven’t felt that painful bloating once. I’m still bloated due to constipation, but nowhere near feeling like I’m going to explode. I still get abdominal pain but that’s bc I’m lactose intolerant. It’s possible your symptoms could be due to something else, of course. But if you have RCPD, it makes sense that that’s the cause.

I used to get what felt like upper right side intercostal pain, bad enough to make me hold my breath for a while, but I don't remember it getting as far as my shoulder. It hasn't happened for three or four years; until your question I'd forgotten about it. Random pains elsewhere of course; lower right, mid left, discomfort like a weight hung between my hips in the base of my spine...

I think I've had issues in the past with specific brands of tea, back before I recognised that trapped air and bloating were the cause of my life-long issues.

I drink almost exclusively Darjeeling tea at home, and its effects are marginal; I might avoid it if I'm already uncomfortable, but it generally improves my day.

As someone mentioned, last week I think, not all gas relief medicines are created equal. The ones designed to conglomerate all the gas, so you can burb, are counterproductive. I get relief from reflux with Gaviscon double action tablets, especially if I'm lying down and trying to get some sleep

I've given up on coffee. I prefer tea and the risk/reward equation for coffee had just stopped balancing.

I've not suffered weight loss, but I do suspect I have problems absorbing enough micronutrients; I take an iron supplement regularly (after iron deficiency was diagnosed) and I've been experimenting with probiotics. I have other symptoms that may be linked to vitamin deficiencies.

I notice a small worsening of symptoms on a short term basis with Covid or flu, but my symptoms took a turn for the worse about five years ago following some trivial food poisoning event.

Sorry to hear you botox didn't do the trick. I'm not sure I'll ever find the nerve to try it.

As I get older I find my sleep is often interupted for no apparent cause, but I recognise the pattern you mentioned. For me it's generally one to two hours after I get to sleep, I'll wake with that feeling. This usually happens if I eat and drink too close to bedtime. Not eating within three hours of going to bed will prevent it for me.

There's no sure-fire solution. I generally trying writhing for a while, hoping to shift the gas, sip some water or take a double-action Gaviscon. I'm fortunate that if I lie on my left side, it generally controls the nausea.

I think FODMAP is a useful guide if you are trying to avoid foods that will ferment in your gut and add to the bloating issues. I've toyed with it because if I ignore my gut problems for long enough, I can trigger an IBS-like flare-up, though I've never gone to the trouble of getting it diagnosed as such. My problem with FODMAP is that it allows many ingredients that I know cause trouble in 'small servings'; it doesn't provide an objective measure of small, nor does it address combinations of small servings of multiple potential triggers. I find if I try to stick to FODMAP closely I end up with a highly restricted diet. Some foods are variably FODMAP in any case. I can eat apples all day at some times of year, but can't risk a single one at others, and the same goes for much fresh produce.

I eat dried nuts as a 'food supplement' to try and address nutrient absorption issues, but some suppliers products cause severe pain, and others are fine with, ostensibly, the same contents.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, by all means try FODMAP, but in the end, finding out your own triggers is more useful.

This condition keeps producing odd symptoms; maybe we stretch something, eat the wrong thing, and it takes a while for a better equilibrium to establish again.

I get a feeling somewhat like the one you describe, and at its worst it can make all my back teeth ache too. I usually use Gaviscon double action tablets for any effects at the top of my oesophagus, and they also seem to help with moving trapped gas onwards sometimes.

I had a similar spell of flare-ups, similar to what you describe, stretching over a couple of years - a long time ago now. Reassessing various episodes of GI trouble from the perspective of R-CPD, I'm pretty sure these were part and parcel of the condition. I think my episodes were triggered by anxiety at the time, so I can only suggest you try some breathing exercises and be kind to yourself.

I self diagnosed with GERD before I became aware that RCPD was a condition that fitted the full spectrum of GI symptoms, but I self-diagnosed with any number of other conditions too. The RCPD causes such a wide spectrum, it's hard for professionals who are not suffers to understand the full complications of 'simply' being unable to get rid of gas.

I had a brief flirt with PPIs, prescribed I suspect by instinct rather than any specific theraputic idea; they were utterly useless. But of course, no random prescription comes without its side-effects and they in turn all have possible pharmacutical remediations. Before you know you'll be taking half a dozen things, when all you need is the botox.

My doctor has concluded that my refusal to take his random prescriptions is an indication that I'm not serious about addressing my problems. His continued inability to listen has convinced me that it's futile trying to convince him I have a condition he's going to have to do more than ten minutes of reading to begin to understand. I'll be moving house soon, so I'll get a new GP, then I'll start again, and probably have to refuse PPIs, again.

Stand your ground.

Seasickness is rarely fatal, but sufferers often don't find this information comforting. Needing to burp, but being unable, can be similar.

I get episodes of similar pain, lasting hours to weeks. It's been pretty good lately, but I suffered for a couple of weeks earlier in the year. I used to think this was gas in my stomach, but I'm fairly sure it is in the bowel.

I'm sure we can all relate to a weird and confounding list of symptoms, even of they're not the same in everyone. I could add that after emptying bowel and bladder, I often have a full bladder less than half an hour later. I suspect I've had episodes of auto brewery syndrome when my bowels aren't moving and I've eaten too many carbs.

Bloating can certainly lead to palpitations in my case, but cardio checks show nothing awry. I suspect this is a vagus nerve issue.

I think most of us have had the condition life-long, so rather than there being a sudden change in ability to burp or vomit, we become aware that we aren't normal, sometimes after a sudden worsening of the condition. I've had a few incidents of gastric bug or minor food poisoning that have had lasting effects, as you describe. The link to anxiety is common. I'm sure many here have self-diagnosed any number of explanations, especially GERD or IBS, and had similar reactions from uniformed professionals, before learning about RCPD.

Sorry to hear the state you're in. I associate the hiccups with bloating, but also acid in my throat that causes discomfort and that horrible spasm that feels like hiccups.

My go-to medication to improve comfort is Gaviscon Double Action Tablets. I take these if I can't get to sleep because of acid on my throat. If you can't get any medication, I'd recommend sipping cold water, slowly enough that you don't swallow it, just let it run to the back of your throat. If you are choking you are going way too fast.

If you are plagued with excess saliva then maybe try spitting it so you don't swallow. In your state swallowing will almost certainly take more air in.

when I was working I used to snack all day to gain short term relief from the throat pressure symptoms; I'd eat moderately at lunch time. It helped at the time, except for rotting my teeth, but now I try to stick to regular meals - three a day, and minimise snacking.

I was certainly more productive if I could avoid eating too many carbs in the middle of the day.

Interesting, thank you. I've been a great fan of Gaviscon dual action (tablets) to improve throat comfort, but I might give the mint liquid a try. I'd already discovered the water sipping idea, and if I try that tongue technique it feels like it has some promise.

I'm scheduled for a procedure in November, but every little helps when it comes to teaching those tricksy muscles to behave.

I find sipping water slowly enough that it doesn't need you to swallow frequently, but just trickles down the throat, helps.

I advocate the Gaviscon double action tablets to soothe the acid reflux feeling. I don't think I've ever needed more than two for an incident. Unfortunately they're reasuringly expensive if you end up popping them like sweets.

If you don't have symptoms I wouldn't have a procedure, unless you have a health plan that will cover the cost.

Most people find this sub because of the symptoms, which are pretty universal: intestinal gurgles, throat croaks, insane hiccups, bloat, nausea, feelings of a bubble in the throat, episodic contipation, difficulty getting comfortable. The condition correlates highly with emetophobia and anxiety, though it's hard to say in which direction there may be any causality. It appears to be slightly heritable.

My experience is that it is increasingly debilitating with age. There were times in my thirties it hardly affected me.

I don't know how Gaviscon market their products internationally, so YMMV. I think double action is different to extra strength.

More or less as you describe. I think gurgles are purely internal. The other noise is a crackle, or as you describe a gargle, which is air travelling up and down the oesophagus, but not escaping in any quantity. Perhaps your gargles are 'mico-burps', if they offer some relief.

Shortness of breath is a consequence of intestinal bloating, because there's gas trapped there.

I'd recommend trying to find someone who will treat you. Treatment depends on where you live, and finding a specialist who will understand the problem.

I take probiotics because I think they help with the secondary effects of RCPD; not the bloat and discomfort directly, but I think due to way the air travelling through our guts affects all aspects of digestion, the probiotics can help with absorption of nutrients and maybe bowel regularity too.

Your presentation of the condition sounds pretty classic. Yes there's an anxiety link; many of us get relief from lying down. I completely understand the work performance issues.

It may be useful to work out what you were doing differently on holiday; consider diet and physical activity paricularly, they may provide a pointer for something that might work for you.

If you can't escape the anxiety, there's not much that will help. Personally I use Gaviscon dual action tablets for pain due to the gurgles.

As a community, we're folk unable to burp, so my first question is are you sure you are burping, rather than having air rattling in your oesophagus?

Magnesium has been recommended for heart palpitations.

Your problems may well be something irritating your vagus nerve. If you are getting a sore throat from acid reflux then that may be a cause. I'm a fan of double action Gaviscon tablets.

Don't eat late in the evening (three hours before bed).

Maybe accept you're going to die one day? Anxiety is not helpful, and it sounds llike this condition isn't going to be the thing that'll kill you.

If you can't burp, or rarely burp, given your symptoms you may have RCPD. Most of us are self-diagnosed because there's very few specialists who are familiar with the condition, and even fewer general practitioners.

I didn't mean you should stop looking both ways before you cross, just that if you've had an all clear over the cardiac symptoms, then those are unlikely to kill you, so having anxiety about them is likely to make you feel worse.

The Gaviscon I take are quite powdery, they don't get gummy.

I think it is one of the most important functions of this sub, to answer the 'do I have it?' questions, because so many people have a history of being told by medical practitioners that they're making it up, or they've got GERD, or having anti-acid medication pressed on them. As a group we are uniquely placed to be able to diagnose this condition, and this includes people like you, who have self-diagnosed. For me, validation was a big step.

If you want treatment, then how you go about it depends on where you are. See the sub wiki for a wide variety of information including a more complete list of symptoms, and regional practitioners who will treat this condition.

I have periods when I can eat apples, and periods when I can't. It occurs to me that the modern food industry, that ensures that fruits are no longer seasonal, must do some strange things to fruit to store it, and to ripen it when required for sale. I've not made a scientific study of when I can or can't eat apples without getting bloated and uncomfortable, but I suspect the way the fruit has been kept before it gets to the supermarket shelf may have an effect. It might explain a seasonal effect, as you describe.

Personally, I may not make conscious changes to my diet at this time of year, but the hamster part of my brain is trying to lay down a layer of fat, ready for winter. Perhaps you too are increasing your portions sizes? Eating more carbs?

As an occasional data scientist, I completely understand your desire to approach this problem with that toolset. I've got plenty of questions myself that could be illuminated.

Data is going to be the problem. I don't think anyone is collecting data, other than very basic information that those who treat us keep. Probably all that's collected is age, sex, and some measure of successful treatment, and the dose. Collecting data on the sub will not give you enough data points, and be subject to all kinds of bias.

You would need to do a proper clinical investigation, maybe using information from those seeking treatment, but you'd have to get permission to use the data and deal with patient confidentiality rules. Good luck.

Having not done my homework, I went to see Lucy at a clinic where she didn't have the equipment to treat me for RCPD. She's pretty accepting of self-diagnosis, and asked me about symptoms. I listed a few, she listed a few more. It was obvious I fitted the profile, and, if you can't burp and recognise some of the other common symptoms people discuss on this sub, then the chances are high that you too have RCPD and may benefit from treatment. I'm seeing her again in the Chelsea clinic next month for treatment.

This kind of thing is what makes this condition so difficult for the medical profession to diagnose.

My theory FWIW: Acid makes your throat uncomfy when burps fail, but bring stomach acid up the oesophagus. Reduced acid leads to less discomfort, less swallowing to try to alleviate discomfort, less swallowed air that would add to your bloating.

Your lack of burping may have a psychological factor, but you may be emetophobic because vomiting is painful or difficult because the same muscle that is stopping you from burping is also interfering with that process.

I can only offer sympathy. Sorry it's not working out for you at the moment.

Without having spent more than fifty years of discomfort, flatulence and strange gastric noises, and too many hours of that time laying down to try and get relief, I wouldn't consider Botox; I'm booked next month.

I know the treatment has quite a good success rate, but I think of it more like electro-convulsive therapy than a surgical intervention like appendectomy. We're not removing an unneccessary organ, we're trying to shock a muscle into learning new tricks.

I don't know what else is gong on in your life, and maybe there's something you can't avoid in any case. My symptoms are heavily linked to anxiety, so I've a couple of books worth of coping strategies for that. Unfortunately the same discomfort can be caused by excitement, by sociability. I'm trying to get some pre-emptive therapy in case the Botox works; I need to know I can cope with finding out how much of my life has been wasted by this condition.

Fortunately, I'm mostly a 'glass half full' person. I can't abandon hope for too long, it keeps coming back to me. Hope's all I can offer you.

That's interesting. I don't often get acid reflux, but even if I'm just too uncomfy to sleep I find a double action Gaviscon tablet will help. The problem with gas medication is half of it is designed to help 'normal' people burp the gas out; it just acts like a surfactant, allowing all the gas to accumulate in a large bubble.

If you think you are generating gas then a dietry approached might work, low FODMAP, or probiotics.

Thanks for your input, and sorry to hear about the horse you lost to colic. I've not heard of anyone with fatal complication of RCPD yet, but I'm reminded of the old joke: "People suffering seasickness are sometimes distressed to hear that it is rarely fatal."

My question was partially a serious one, after all, horse colic has been treated by careing horse owners for years, probably hundreds of years. I was interested to browse the guidelines for its treatment to find the modern emphasis on pain relief. I do find that if I can get over the discomfort RCPD occasionally causes me, relieving the symptoms becomes easier, presumably because of the decrease in anxiety.

I'm 61, scheduled first treament next week.

When I first discovered that my whole life had been affected by this condition that no GP I ever visited had any inkling about, I was happy to hear there may be a cure. But I've arrived as the person I am, adopted habits that minimise the symptoms, and I don't know how to live any other way. I had to stop and think about whether to get the treatment; I've actually begun counselling with an intention of learning what sort of person I could be without RCPD to hold me back.

I've read about some of the bad experiences people have had from treatment, but all these side effects are limited by the time it takes for the Botox to wear off. No time at all compared to a lifetime of discomfort. So Although I had reservations about seeking treatment, they were never to do with the side effects, only how a cure would affect me. The potential benefits seem huge. I may not end up any happier; I may find I have a lot of regrets, but I'll have more energy to deal with life, less pain and discomfort on a daily basis.

A few burps Tuesday, Wednesday, and in bed Wednesday night my tummy was actually like a bag of offal rather than the usual drum skin.

Worried last night (Thursday) because I was back to uncomfortable for that.

Been burping quite regularly today and had first real slow swallow with some Greek yogurt and ripe banana late afternoon. Then played badminton with no ill effects followed by a pint of ale. Had burps matching the CO2 from the beer, so I actually didn't bloat at all. Still having a mixture of croaks and burps and one or two hiccups, but feeling pretty comfy.

Quite a few are croaks that actually produce a small burp at the end. I also notice air just silently bubbling up in my throat.

So far I'm not making any progress beyond that, but I've developed a bit of a snuffle which may be surpressing things. I have had improvements in the bloating, which appears to indicate that there's a net benefit even if I'm not consciously burping a lot.

Sorry to hear you didn't have success; I feel some relief, but it's not reliable (2 weeks in). If your procedure was unsuccessful you can get a second round for just the cost of the Botox, so it may be worth telling her up front that you don't think it worked first time.

Two weeks since the Botox, It's hard to say how much success I'm having. It could go either way, but at least the treament had an effect initially. I've hope for the future, even if it means more doses.

I am 62; the condition, RCPD, wasn't even on the books until I was 57 and I didn't self-diagnose until this year. I had an in-office procedure on the 6th and it's too early to call success or failure.  I gave up work nearly seven years ago because the condition was affecting my ability to concentrate; just too uncomfortable every day. I can look back with regret on a long sequence of adverse effects this condition has had on my life.

But. In the last three weeks, I've eaten an apple and some tomatoes. I've gone to bed comfortable a few times, rather than bloated and restless. I'm an optimist.

You are young. Some small part of the medical profession now recognises what ails you. There is a treatment available with a good rate of success, and we know it doesn't work for everyone first time, and that sometimes it takes two or three attempts. I've an inkling how you feel now; I know how I felt through years of being unable to convince a doctor that there was anything actually wrong with me.

This sounds like a classic symptom, and I'm sorry to say that experience suggests it will get worse. Before I was aware that being unable to burp was a problem, well before RCPD was invented, I used to get a tight chest caused by my sternum being only partly fused. It was possible to release the tension by looking over each shoulder in turn as far as I could; twisting the upper body as far as it would go. You could give that a try, but it's most likely the RCPD.

It sounds likely to me that you have RCPD. I'd say your next step would be to contact one of the specialists listed in the sub wiki, and then figure out how to finance a treatment.

Here in the UK, the National Health Service appears to have no knowledge or interest in RCPD. Treatment is in the private sector, and while I'm sure they are concerned for patient welfare, they respond well to being offered money to fix problems. I saw a specialist, I told them I had RCPD, we talked a bit about the procedure, I paid and was treated.

In answer, yes. Not burping could be the whole problem. I'm a month and a half after my first treatment which achieved some brief relief, and is still having a positive effect, but I don't think is going to cure me on its own. While it was working all my symptoms went away.

Many folk here claim emetophobia, but I'm not sure it's the right term. A phobia is an irrational fear.  With RCPD we fear vomiting because it's a painful and distressing process simply because the same muscle that prevents us from burping also prevents vomiting unless the pressure created by the stomach is excessive.

My experience of getting food poisoning at the same time as a friend who is normal is that they throw up, and four hours later they're fine while I'm just about considering dry toast after two or three days of pain and discomfort.

I got over the irrational part of the fear in my late teens, just by being around other boys my age who regularly drank too much alcohol, while I had to stop after two or three drinks.

I understand that fear. I'm not a therapist and I never saw a therapist for emotophobia, but I guess you could look on my time at university as a sort of immersion therapy. I spent time with vomiting people and came to understand their path through the process (Since then I've had children, and an unerring instinct for when a chikld is about to vomit is a handy life skill).

The need to vomit cause s a psychological pressure to build that distracts you from everything else; it's a directionless drive that makes you antsy, distressed and irritable. RCPD triggers this feeling, but it never leads to the catharsis of actually releasing the pressure and throwing up, plus it probably triggers memories of earlier painful efforts to vomit.

Normal folk, once they've vomited, get instant relief that clears this psychological dread and gives tham a clarity and mild euphoria for a while (until the next bout sets in). It's possible to get to this with RCPD if you can 'air-vomit' - if you don't know what I mean check the sub wiki. I've spontaneously air vomited a few times, but I can't bring myself to trigger it. It's only happened when I've been in pain and on the verge of losing bowel control.

My advice is to be aware of the existential feeling of dread brought on my the nausea and to maybe think about what it is you are actually scared of. All the best.

Not heard it descibed by anyone, but my 'sore throat' was more of an ache, and it felt to me that the part of the cricopharyngeal muscle that had not been numbed was trying to compensate for the Botoxed part; so more of a tired muscle ache than soreness.

It sounds valid to me. For the in-office procedure I was monitored by emg to determine that the Botox needle was in the right place. The consultant said that my cricopharyngeal muscle was 'pretty buzzy', it was very tense and likely to be causing RCPD.

If you can take anti-acids for the reflux as a temporary measure, I recommend Double Action Gaviscon tablets, they're a life saver for me, especially before lying down to sleep. When my RCPD symptoms flare-up I get worse acid reflux and at the worst, my bowels show IBS symptoms. I've not had that blood test done though.

You need to access one of the UK providers of treatment directly, or get lucky with an ENT specialist who is willing to listen and learn.

My own first Botox treatment did not quite do the trick, but I foresaw the problem you describe and tried to get preemptive counselling. In fact I began by trying to answer the question whether a cure was really what I wanted. The counselling is ongoing, but I can't say it will definitely help. My therapist at least understands that, along with being a life-long burden, RCPD has also given me an excuse for some of my past behaviour. There's a desire to change, but it's hard. I am perhaps still using avoidant behaviour, as you describe, but my particular bugbear is the feeling of regret, of a better life not lived.

Sorry if that's not helpful, but I understand your position.

I am still burping occasionally, two months post treatment, but not enough to provide relief. I suspect that after decades of being full of air, my stomach no longer tries to force it out as soon as it arrives; it needs some trigger. I find carbonated water a little too vigorous, but Nutella sandwiches seem to trigger burping. I'm still experimenting to try and return to the happy state I was in for two weeks post procedure, when my bloating was briefly cured.

If you get no effects, I'd talk it over with your practitioner and insurance, to see what can be done. Ms Hicklin, who does the in-office procedure in London does a free second attempt if there are no indications that the Botox made a difference at all - just for the cost of the Botox itself, but obviously the costs of the GA procedure are more complex.

I am 62M and haven't vomited for nearly fifty years. I've had what I believe is a common experience of worsening RCPD symptoms with age. My experience of emetophopia is much like yours, though having had a young family, that total aversion to the smell and just the word 'sick' is something I've happily grown out of.

I had a first attempt at treatment at the end of last year. It hasn't been fully successful, although on a good day I can still burp a little. I did have almost two weeks of blessed relief from symptoms, and I'll have another go.

I think although we use the term emetophobia, it doesn't really fit our condition. RCPD causes a perfectly rational fear of vomiting due to the discomfort verging on pain we feel before the pressure of our stomach's can overcome the obstruction of our throat. Successful treatment removes this problem with vomiting, as well as confering the ability to burp, so I think there's no need to fear. I didn't suffer any worse acid reflux after treatment than before, just a little manageable slow swallow.

M62, 50 units with Ms Hicklin three months ago. I had a couple of weeks relief from bloating but I'm almost back to the old normal now. Burped from about day four, £850 treatment in Chelsea. Slow swallow for six weeks, but after the first week I was accustomed to it and it only requires a mouthful of water to overcome the temporary discomfort. Some reflux unless I stopped eating four hours before bed.

I found Lucy to be very good; she asked me enough questions to be sure of my self-diagnosis. She explained side effects, etc perfectly clearly - and I think they are well covered by the discussions here too.

I'll have another go in the future. I'd recommend trying to get treatment while you are young. The longer you wait the more accustomed your intestines will be to bloat, and the less you will naturally try to initiate burps after treatment.

Good luck.

Unfortunately what you describe sounds perfectly normal. I'm sorry to hear you are having a bad time of it. I've even had the same reaction to paracetamol in some circumstances.

Other then (Botox) treatment, the only mitigation I can suggest is to learn to breathe mindfully. I learned to prevent full-on panic attacks that way, and it can provide respite from the worst of anxiety. What it can't help immediately with is when the gut is already full of trapped gas, but by taking control of the anxiety it improves your chances of restoring the gut to its usual flatulent ways.

I began with breathing exercises a long time ago, and I can't remember if there was a single resource I found helpful. Although I don't use meditation, there are some useful tips in "10% Happier", Dan Harris. I think I probably Googled for panic attack treatments originally.

The feeling of needing to vomit but being unable is relatable, but I don't think I ever felt I was choking. What does happen though is that it becomes almost impossible to operate the diaphragm because of the tension in all the muscles in the abdomen; the airway isn't blocked, but you can't take a breath.

Try taking tiny sips of water. I don't mean sip and then swallow; tiny sip and let the water slowly make its way to your throat; breathe slowly and mindfully if you can. Swallow when you have to.

Title    : Forty years ago. rant
Selftext :
I am M62, living in England.

This is all going to sound very vague, but it’s a memory that came back to me last night.

Between forty and fifty years ago, possibly in the Sunday Times, there was a weekly column written by a GP that described a patient’s symptoms and his diagnosis. These were either slightly mysterious, or common ailments, and for a slightly hypochondriac youth they made fascinating reading. I can’t remember now a single case except one, which must have struck a chord because the symptoms described all fitted my own at the time. The GP’s conclusion was dismissive and his advice to this patient was to stop worrying everyone with all these symptoms he was suffering just because he had ‘learned’ to swallow too much air.

So for forty, or fifty years I’ve carried this slight guilt about my symptoms, thinking that they were in some sense my fault, and that all I needed to do was pull myself together, or buckle up, or some such pithy advice.

Last year I heard about RCPD for the first time and, as we generally all do, immediately self-diagnosed.

Here is my (tongue in cheek) plan: I’m going to build a time machine and do my research and go back to visit this GP. I’ll sit on his chest and torture him until he gives me the name of the patient. I might torture him a bit more after. I will find this patient and explain myself and, no doubt, discover that he was an RCPD sufferer. I will commiserate with him that treatment will not be available, possibly in his lifetime. I’ll probably give him a hug, even though, forty years ago, it wasn’t the sort of thing that men did to strangers.

It's always a comfort when a highly qualified professional can give you a name for your problem, but can't do anything practical to help, unless of course you are talking to a managment consultant, because, essentially that is all they can do.

I have palpitations, arrhythms, an occasional racing heartbeat, and I didn't link this with the RCPD (that I didn't know I had until last year), because they run in the family to some extent. I've had all the cardio tests, with no conclusion, except whatever it was, it didn't seem likely to kill me.

First dose was November 2023. I think all trace of the effects had worn off in a couple of months, certainly three months. I think I learned a little about how my throat should feel when it relaxes to burp, but I can't do it unaided. I've been doing 'shaker' exercises - when I remember - for about three weeks, and it may be helping with some micro-burps, but they aren't providing any relief.

No infusion, but daily ferrous fumerate for five years now. I added a spoon of bran to my breakfast bowl, and that seemed to restore my previous (irregular) habit.

I've had flare-ups due to eating or drinking the wrong thing, usually in combination with anxiety. These can last three months with increased pain and nausea and even unprompted air-vomitting. No correlation with taking iron supplements though. I usually try probiotics to deal with a flare-up, but I've no evidence they do any good.

Until someone mentions that you may not be able to burp, it wouldn't necessasrily occur to you that this was a strange thing. Being unable, we don't know what a 'need to burp' feels like. We only know we suffer from an array of gastric symptoms from hiatal hernia, through low bowel motility and bloating to IBS-like symptoms and excessive flatulence. We also suffer what we call throat nausea, which may indeed correspond to a need to burp.

Those of us who have overcome the condition, however briefly, can attest to the massive relief that not being full of air brings. I had a blissful week off symptoms after treatment last year.

Although the physical effects of this condition have been studied and described now, the psychological side is still little understood. I concur with your description of suppressed feelings. I assume I've always kept my feelings under control because any form of excitement, good or bad, can lead to swallowing additional air, and I've learned to avoid that.

You're getting microburps and 'real' burps. The wisdom here suggests that forcing burps is bad, but while the botox is doing its job it is helpful to practise by drinking carbonated drinks. I'm not sure my first treatment was ever successful enough to risk fuelling that fire.

I've argued in the past that with RCPD we don't get 'irrational fear of vomiting', we have a perfectly rational aversion to that feeling of being unable to throw up until we are in severe pain. I've not throw up for more than forty years, but my emetophobia does not affect everyday life the way it used to. Those who have had successful treatment generally report that if they vomit, it is far less unpleasant than before the procedure, so you can cling on to that possibility.

I was already burping a little by the end of the day yesterday, and progress has continued today. I had been improving micro-burps already with shaker exercises for the last month. Sat with a bottle of Plum Porter this afternoon; the burps don't taste quite as good as it does on the way down, but I never enjoyed carbonated water.

Title    : Second treatment; laryngospasm
Selftext :
100U in office procedure on Wednesday led to very rapid onset of uncontrolled burping and all the usual side-effects (< 24 hours). My throat has been getting a bit ragged and sensitive.

Foolishly tried sipping a beer this afternoon. Each little mouthful was triggering burps and mild choking. About the sixth triggered a laryngospasm.

Thanks for the heads-up guys. I could barely breath, but I knew what was going on. Back to sipping water now. My voice hasn't quite recovered fifteen minutes later.

Hoping this attempt works. The burps are spectacular.

It sounds to me as if you are not going to get any more relief from this round. I understand completely the problem with anxiety while you are trying to concentrate on the changes treatment brings about.

I started shaker exercises a month before my second shot and made some progress with micro-burbs before treatment. I didn't get any measurable benefit though, in terms of reduced bloating.

I'm a week post injection now, and into burps and side-effects and I don't think I could lay flat to do shakers without getting reflux.

Be aware that although an ENT condiiton, RCPD can cause a lot of GI symptoms. I don't know what else you are taking medicine for, but if it's gut related, there's a chance that curing RCPD will fix them too. RCPD appears to cause iron deficiency in some sufferers too.

A few people have mentioned it on the sub. I (62M) discovered I was iron deficient because I was regularly turned away for blood donation. You can look up the symptoms, but I was suffering some fatigue and poor concentration. I've been on ferrous fumerate for four years.

The connection to RCPD is that it (probably) has an effect on absorption of micro-nutrients due to damage caused by excess air travelling through the gut. I've not had any other deficiencies flagged after several blood tests, but I eat quite a good diet.

I think flare-ups are a common experience for RCPD. I've lived many years with it as only a mild inconvenience, but then it becomes disabling for a while. My current 'flare-up' has been going on since 2019 I think, following a buffet food poisoning incident. Recovery seems to require an absence of anxiety, and I try to take probiotics, but I'm not sure if they help or not.

If you can't burp, it's RCPD. Your other symptoms: emetophobia, not vomiting, gassy, all confirm. The gurgles, creaks and pops are common as. Bloating, discomfort, occasional pain, continuous nausea... Diagnosis as IBS, overprescription of ant-acids. Join the club.

I would not try to put you off getting treatment.

Some of the problems are due to well-known side effects, such as getting stomach contents back in the throat after bending or lying down too soon after eating. Mostly it's an interaction between acid and food hitting my already inflamed larynx. I just had to pause and suck a Gaviscon on the way to the local shops FFS.

Side effects of Botox wear off in less than four months. I was and am willing to take the risk of having a torrid couple of months for a chance of a lasting cure.

I don't know how RCPD interacts with your EDS. Sorry to hear you are suffering. I've a vague memory of someone correlating RCPD with hypermobility, but it's not something I suffer.

After learning about RCPD I kept getting little revelations for the next six months of times when it had governed my life in ways I had not realised at the time. So that's why I used to lie down and gurgle; so that's why I couldn't drink more than two pints of beer... All that suppression of strong emotions; appearing calm and feeling anxious. A hundred little things rounded off by the casual dismissal from the medical profession.

You described my last week. Had Botox with Lucy on the 8th and almost immediately went down with a respiratory tract infection of some kind. My larynx is super sensitive right now and gets irritated every time a burp comes up a little acid, or while I'm swallowing food.

Double action Gaviscon is a reasonable salve, but my throat gets sore at night even though my temperature now seems normal. I'm experimenting this afternoon with honeycomb icecream; at least the burps taste good.

I've described the problem as finding out that the mucus I am producing is exactly in the range of viscous materials that slow swallow renders impossible to clear from my throat. I lie in bed and gurgle in my throat until it drives me mad enough to rush to the bathroom to cough and spit. I'm getting a bit fed up with it.

Most of my voice has gone missing too. I have about an octave of range to play with now, and that is better than I was on Wednesday, when I coulod just about make Dalek noises.

First attempt 50U in November I had micro-burps in 48 hours, burps 24 hours later and that's about when slow swallow started to kick in.

Second attempt 100U, two weeks ago, everything began all at once and I've only just got back the ability to swallow at all with any confidence, but I had a respiratory tract infection at the same time. Still burping uncontrollably, slow swallow. My throat is still recovery from the infection I think, but I'm more human than last week.

I can only say that following a Botox procedure I still cannot play the piano.

Anecdotally people suffering RCPD have trouble with controlled breathing before treatment, e.g. playing wind instruments, or swimming, so I'm surprised to hear of a sufferer making a living from playing a French horn. It may be that the exercise of playing saves you from some of the bloating symptoms, or that you are young enough that the bloat is still controlled by the elasticity of your innards. I'll repeat the usual advice, which is to get treatment as soom as possible, since the symptoms don't get better with age.

When I had 50U I found that sitting in relaxation, then standing up, would trigger a small burp. Whatever works, except for the 'forcing it' thing, to make you burp; try to store the experience of what your throat felt like when it worked. Puffing yourself up and contorting your neck may expell some air, but it's not how burps work IMO.

I had 100U three weeks ago, and something is changing. I can't be certain it will stick; I can't burp to order, but I have better strategies to encourage them. I know the Botox is still doing a lot of the work, but the familiarity of having (mostly) air arrive back in my throat from my stomach is starting to feel normal.

All the best.

It's a reasonable generalisation that side-effects are a good thing. My slow swallow was noticeable for bread, mashed potato and eating too many digestive biscuits. This time round I've been plagued with a respiratory tract infection and my throat has been horribly sensitive, causing problems with eating and drinking. I still can't drink alcohol, but I've got past choking on everthing.

I think there's a little bit of learning going on with my burp response; I had a terribly sensitive throat that wouldn't even put up with cold water for the first week and a bit because I managed to get an infection at the same time as the Botox kicked in. Much better now. Fingers are crossed.

Although your Botox has failed to address your noburp symptoms, it may still be affecting the amount of air you swallow, or the procedure may have caused you anxiety.

(1) I've had no problems with swallowing.

(2,3,4) I think all of these are bloating related. I suspect bloating affects erectile disfunction. I had a PSA test due to problems with urination, but I'm fairly certain now that was just a bloating issue (urgency to pee). Many people have noted bowel problems due to reduced gut motility because of trapped wind and bloating.

(5) I've not had this problem, but obviously being tired may affect this. It may be worth checking other things, like your iron levels.

I don't think I could ever burp.

As we gather information on RCPD, I'm sure a number of variants will crop up. Some people will have a congenital propensity for not burping, some will develop the condition later; others may have a purely psychological basis for the condition. We're all self-aware lab rats.

I've been keeping a list of foods that inhibit or promote burping. Loosely speaking, fruit and salads seem to make me burp; sugary foods seem to suppress burps. Obviously the Botox is still partially active, so I'm not sure of the relevance of these observations to 'normal' life.

I've not seen ED on the list of symptoms, but thinking back, even to my teens I think I can spot associations between bloat and ED. I suspect we're too squeamish, as a group, to talk about it.

My RCPD can occasionally flare up into something with the symptoms of IBS, but usually only for days or a few weeks at a time. I've found avoiding foods I know trigger me, and taking probiotics, help.

I'm two months after a second treatment now, and my symptoms are returning, though I still retain the ability to burp if I'm relaxed enough. I would say go for the treatment; it may after all be the cause of all your GI issues.

Don't expect a GP to diagnose this; they've not learned about it in school, there's no simple test for it and there's no simple pill they can prescribe to fix it. They may refer you, but it will be to a GI specialist, not the ENT that you need to see. Even if you see an ENT specialist, there's a good chance they haven't heard of it either.

Doctors believe it is a rare condition, because they've never heard of anyone diagnosing it, and no-one got sued for misdiagnosing it.

You have to take the initiative and arrange your own treatment. Contact someone on the list of specialists directly.

RCPD, Retrograde CrycoPharyngeal Disfunction, is a failure of the mechanism that allows retrograde (backwards) function of the muscle at the top of the oesophagus. This disfunction affects air - burps - and vomit. We can't do either. Emetophobia is an 'irrational' fear of vomiting, but the fear is only irrational if the experience is psychologically disturbing. I think RCPD sufferers have a perfectly rational fear of needing to vomit, because it causes that dry heaving and painful experience of being unable to open our throats and let the vomit out.

Of course there may be people who begin with a fear of vomiting and through suppressing the urge, end up with a disfunctional crycopharnygeal muscle response. The physical aspects of RCPD are becoming clearer, but there's little documented about the psychological effects AFAIK.

My experience is that I until I had a second round of Botox in May, I hadn't vomited in 46 years. On this forum I have heard of people with a similar experience, but also people who have vomited. Many people report 'air vomiting', achieved by physically triggering the throat to open, but emetophobes struggle to attempt this.

My memory of vomiting all that time ago is that it was extremely painful and stressful. I have felt a need to vomit but been unable to since that.

RCPD is a spectrum in any case, so I wouldn't say that ability to vomit ruled it out.

Stuck in traffic yesterday I realised I've got my full vocal range back, nearly four months after my second attempt to treat this condition (100 units with Lucy Hicklin). My voice wasn't just affected by the Botox, but by several bouts of upper respiratory tract infection after the treatment. I'm kinda sad because this marks the end of the Botox effect; I've been back to bloating and gurgling and the rest for a couple of months, but I am burping a few times on an average day now, so - progress.

I've come to understand the condition better since I learned it had a name, and a community. Not sure if I'm curable, but I'm willing to give it another go. The temporary relief was amazing and let me know what sort of life I've been missing.

Thanks to this community for its support and help. To anyone who is still wondering whether treatment is worth it, just give it a go. Not sure when I'll be back on the mill, but I will be.

There has been discussion of the FODMAP diet on this sub in the past, but although it reduces gas from digestion, I think most here feel the swallowed gas is the problem. We swallow more air when eating in social situations for example, and this confuses RCPD with social stress and anxiety. Advice to eat quietly and mindfully is all very well, but makes for a dull and lonely life.

Avoiding obvious sources of gas is a first step; no carbonated berverages.

Sorry you are going through a rough experience.

Back in the day the advice was to breathe into a paper bag, but I don't think that's the advice now (but it worked for me). Post Botox I had some laryngospasms, when I couldn't breathe. This can cause symptoms of panic, but since I'd read about them, I was fine.

I know it sounds like simple advice, but try breathing exercises. What I guess are called mindful breathing exercises these days.

Make sure to read up on the side effects:

\- Reflux; don't eat late before bed, get a sleep wedge or lots of pillows.

\- Laryngospasm; exciting, frightening, but very unlikely to kill you  ;-)

Remember you are retraining a reflex. The Botox should allow you to burp, possibly with no control. You have to let it happen until the muscle learns how it works. Then hopefully, when the Botox wears off, your muscle will remember.

Before treatment, you could try doing shaker exercises, they can't do any harm.

Look at the subreddit community bookmarks - wiki.

In the attached wiki are resources for finding local practitioners, as well as original research published by Dr Bastian describing symptoms and the Botox treatment.

Your symptoms are on the spectrum of problems common to RCPD. I personally have no problems swallowing pills. It's possible you have some additional problem with your cricopharyngeal muscle. It is common for ENT doctors who specialise in throat issues to be familiar with swallowing problems; there are less who have any knowledge of RCPD, but any of the practitioners listed in the wiki should be able to discuss all your issues.

I'm not even sure why reflux would be a contra-indication for treatment. I'm not sure what Dr Bastian has said about it.

So I've had persistent bloating, what's so suprising about that resulting in a bit of reflux?

There still seems to ba an assumption that RCPD is a rare condition and that there's "sure to be a more obvious explanation" for RCPD symptoms.

I've had treatment twice with Dr Hicklin in London whose policy appears to be: name two symptoms of RCPD and bring money (I am being extremely flipant here, she's very good).

Doctors who deny your experience of RCPD, without even doing a relevant test, are a PITA.

This.

If you have reflux it is lilkely a side effect of RCPD induced bloating. Having a hiatal hernia is pretty common amongst sufferers. Successful treatment of the RCPD will allow that to heal, along with fixing numerous other side effects.

My second attempt with Botox treatment gave me recurring laryngitis, presumably because of just this problem with reflux. I also had two months of complete relief from RCPD, and another two months of partial relief. TBH in the second week after that treatment I almost lost my voice, and it took a fortnight to recover, but six months later it was entirely back to normal.

A vocal cord specialist is likely to worry about the reflux, but it's unlikely that separate treatment for that is going to be succesful while RCPD is still active.

This is a side effect of the Botox. The Botox is not a 'cure', it can only help your body get accustomed to burping by preventing your throat from blocking retrograde air. You are getting bubbles, which is a positive sign.

You need to try and improve on those bubbles. I'd suggest sitting upright, shoulders relaxed, breathe with your stomach (meditate a little if your so inclined). If you have acid reflux it might be best to start with an ant-acid (I used Double Action Gavison). Have a glass of water - do not drink the water  :-), but you can wet your mouth with it. Experiment by moving your head around - most people find turning their head to the right works, for some reason - and see if you can free a larger burp. It will be disgusting, it may make you feel more nauseous. Then do it again.

I had already had to give up coffee years before my first treatment attempt, so I can't offer any advice on that specifically. I had a couple of weeks after my second treatment when I couldn't eat enough to maintain my weight due to recurring laryngitis. It took six weeks for me to be able to drink alcohol in any form.

The worst of slow swallow was about two weeks for me. I never tried mixing water with food in my mouth, just taking a swig to shift anything that stalled in my throat was enough. I did have a couple of bouts of laryngitis in that period though, with mucus that was exactly at that viscosity that wouldn't go anywhere.

Congratualtions on the burps. Long may they continue.

I'm a couple of years younger than you. Forty years sure sounds rough. I've only had spasms after Botox treatment when reflux would go the wrong way and I'd be stuck in that period of waiting for the next breath to begin. Fortunately I had been warned by someone on this sub that it was a possible side effect, so I didn't panic.

I'm not sure how we can help you; it sounds like you can burp, but have a reaction to reflux sometimes?

I use Double Action Gaviscon to prevent acid reflux from producing similar symptoms. I've not had any investigations beyond a 24 hour heart monitor, so I don;' know if I have hiatal hernia. I take an occasional magnesium supplement, which is supposed to help with palpitations.

I've never been certain which is the cart and which the horse here. I have social anxiety, but every time in my youth I went out for an evening I would have to leave early, feeling ill. I think the anxiety may have developed from there. I lived my life before diagnosing RCPD with the assumption I am introverted, but even that may be a projection from the social anxiety. The root cause may be the RCPD in both cases.

Title    : working my first desk job. help 😰
Selftext :
hello fellow no-burpers. got a few questions for all of you! common introduction, i (22F) haven’t been able to burp for as long as i can remember. i embarrassingly have the gargles multiple times a day after drinking even water or eating something, the bloating, inability to burp, flatulence, etc. and am very happy that i found y’all because all of my life (until finding this sub), i thought i just had this weird, embarrassing thing because when i’d talk about it, even to doctors, i just got weird, blank stares back, and when i gurgled my friends would just make fun of me & laugh and whatever. 

so my first question is; i just started my first 40-hours office job. i’m sitting in a cubicle talking on the phone all day. since i can’t not eat/drink anything but of course when i do, i sound like a frog with a megaphone. y’all know the feeling. and talking on the phone constantly is hard because it’s super embarrassing to do the hiccup thing (not sure if y’all know what this is but it’s basically a super deep hiccup that renders you from talking for a few seconds until it stops) or gargle at customers. anyone have any tips/tricks to at least subdue the gurgles and bloating, etc. during the work day? any more customer service reps in the thread with the same issues? it’s horrible. i just know people around me can hear it. 

my second question is in regards to drinking alcohol. so i’m 22.5 years old and have never even been drunk. why? it’s because whenever i drink any alcohol of any kind, i start sweating a lot, i get really hot, and it makes my tummy hurt super bad. i can never get passed that or even see if there is a “passed that” because that stage is too miserable, i don’t want to keep drinking. i literally never drink alcohol because it’s not fun for me at all. anyone have this experience too? i see people on here say that they have to throw up when they drink but i hate throwing up. i haven’t thrown up in years and plan on keeping it that way for as long as possible. do y’all have this same experience that i do, you just throw up and feel better? or do y’all never experience anything like this? please let me know!! thank u!

Title    : Coffee out of nowhere. Huge trigger ? :(
Selftext :
So to start I just found out about this R-cpd and I’m certain I have it, every symptom I’ve experienced it, lately it’s been getting so bad and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m getting older or what but I have crazy health anxiety too and it doesn’t help.

 For many years my only my trigger was alcohol which it would go away if I air vomited,  my whole life I’ve been able to drink coffee without affecting me, but now even if I have a cup in the morning after breakfast it makes me so sick all day and I get the gurgles practically all day, if I don’t have coffee it’s mostly fine except for maybe some hiccups here and there, but if I have coffee I’m miserable all day, it sucks because I love coffee :(

Did your symptoms get worse out of nowhere?

Selftext :
I’ve never been able to burp and even tho I’m not diagnosed R-cpd lately it’s been hell, having gurgles as type this while eating soup for dinner, 

It hasn’t been this bad until recently once I turned 40 it has gotten a LOT worse and seems like symptoms came out of nowhere, before it was mainly just  anytime I had alcohol. 
Now it’s even when I drink water. I get gurgles and hiccups, mind you they are not painful but still quite annoying, oddly enough if I do some type of cardio I’m able to chug water and feel okay.

 Right now water and  hot spicy soup seemed to be my main triggers, I have a drs appointment next week and I’m wondering if it’s even worth going. Where do I even start??  Also my health anxiety is telling me maybe it’s hiatal hernia, 
h pylory or something like that, even tho I’ve never been able to burp, it hasn’t been this bad until now :( 

I just want to drink water like a normal person lol

A couple years back when I was 16, I’m 21 now, I went to the chiropractor‘s to get my back adjusted from a previous injury and they had to take an x-ray before the adjustment. When my doctor came in to show me the x-ray he pointed out that I had a bunch of pockets of air in my chest and he said that he never saw that before… Has anyone else gotten an x-ray of your chest and if so did you see bubbles too? It’s been a couple years since then but I remember that x-ray and what he said vividly

EDIT: Even though only like five people have commented… It’s just really nice to know that other people have experienced something similar and I’m not crazy. Just the other day I was talking to my mom about it and she tried to make up a bunch of different excuses on what else it could be and acted like I was crazy. I know for sure that it correlates with not being able to burp.

I was in varsity track and cross-country when I was in middle school. Then my no burping symptoms got worse in high school, to the point where I couldn’t even run a mile. I used to run 7 to 12 miles a day and then by sophomore year I could only run a mile. Now when I try to even walk up a flight of stairs I am extremely exhausted and I have a hard time breathing. As a kid/teenager I stopped drinking soda because I noticed that I started to breathe better when I didn’t drink it. I never realized until I was around 20 and I found this sub Reddit, that it was because I couldn’t burp. There’s so much air and gas trapped in my chest that I can’t do physical day-to-day activity that much anymore… So the fact that you are even able to do what you do is amazing. I hope that you get to continue doing what you love to do but in a more comfortable way!

For the first time in my life I can say that my pushy personality has helped me lol, but the doctors have usually believed me because I have pulled every little tiny piece of evidence that I could. A couple years back I went in for an x-ray at my chiropractor‘s and my entire chest was filled with air and gas bubbles (this was right before I had to quit running and after 2 years of no carbonation), my chiropractor was thoroughly confused and didn’t know what was going on but it was good evidence that I used for other doctors. When it comes to treatments and stuff nothing has worked, but I have not tried botox yet!

I am going to be moving to Germany soon but my husband has been telling me to look into getting the surgery in the UK instead of the US. 

From your experience were you able to get this covered by insurance?

Also, I am terrified of surgery and needles so how was the process to you?

If you dont mind me asking; Where or who is the doctor you are going to? I’m currently living in Germany and early last year when I checked there werent many in the surrounding countries who offered treatment. I’d love to get it done closer to home!

My husband has been begging me for years now to find somewhere close for botox treatment because I’m honestly suffering but, I’m stubborn for some reason and I think I’ve been putting up with the symptoms for so long that I just dont even try to look for relief anymore.

Title    : Hey so I have a few questions
Selftext :
So I am part of this gang, am 26 but have never burped my entire life. I don't bloat like everyone else, but I do eat extremely healthy. Lately I have been spitting not stop. Maybe spit 1.5 liters a day, maybe more. I had found this group researching this issue.

Has anyone else has salvitation issues? 
Recently weed has been much of an issue, it can cause me to become sick at times. 

Should I consider the botox if I am a point where I don't know how it is effecting me? 

What is the gurgle you guys are talking about? I have some weird stomach and throat stuff for sure.

Look up diamond pose and sit like that. It will help air through and digestion. Infact I do it after every meal I have, and during. If I am at a Booth at a restaurant I even do it. Of next is chew your food, be as mindful as you can. The better you get at this the less you will experience such bad symptoms. And of course avoid alcohol, especially with food as it is just badness waiting to happen.

For all of us who do not care to do botox but still live with this shit, i do recommend ghee on a empty stomach when you wake up. You may fart a little bit more but it definitely helps keep your digestion in a good flow. I do about a teaspoon every morning.

Well I am less likely to experience throat croaks and stomach pressure due to the ghee allowing my digestion to be speedy. Lots of farts tho. I highly recommend it, I use everyday and poop very regularly. I find this to be a game changer. If your case is extremely bad then 1 teaspoon of ghee can be added to every meal

Hey brother it's all about your diet unfortunately.  You definitely need to look into what your eating, as I've had this for quite some (1-2 years of heart and chest pain) and found if I don't eat natural non processed foods, I'll generally feel as if a heart attack is waiting for me. Maybe rcpd exaggerates the food we eat, and makes it worse for us in general. Definitely not an easy undertaking but stay away from meat, dairy, processed foods. Sorry brother

Title    : Hey does anyone get relief from the internal hiccups?
Selftext :
I can't burp but I do get the internal hiccups, while it doesn't seem like air is released, I feel the pressure of the air let's out a very small percentage of air to escape. But any time I seem to smoke weed this air does get trapped and I am left in discomfort with no hiccups to help me and today I was bout near close to doing the air vomit. Usually doesn't get to those lengths because I feel most of the time the internal hiccups give me the relief I am looking for although it takes like 40 and an hour of it going on to pr9bably do what one burp could. Anyways just curious about anyone else

Title    : Marijuana & Botox
Selftext :
Has anyone who has gotten the botox procedure been a daily marijuana smoker? I smoke medically regularly (multiple times a day) and have been planning to stop 3-4 weeks before my procedure. But I have read scary things about anesthesia and regular pot smoking so I am curious what everyone else knows? I read to tell your anesthesiologist but I also dont want him to give me too much and me never wake up or something 😂 Is me quitting for almost a month enough to not need to deal with explaining it?

Title    : Daily weed / botox
Selftext :
Hey y'all,

I think I asked this a few weeks ago but now that I'm closer to my procedure I'm wondering if this will even make a difference and hoping for some extra reach. I am a daily medical marijuana user and my procedure is on Friday. I slowed down for the last like week or so, but was thinking about stopping all together from now until Friday. Will it make a difference? Did you tell your anesthesiologist before getting the procedure? Am I going to wake up during surgery? Lol. I would prefer not to disclose but if others did then maybe I should..

Idk why I'm so nervous I just don't want him to use extra anesthesia or something if he doesn't need to.

​

Thanks in advance - I can't wait to see if I can burp after this.

I never, or very very rarely burp. Instead after I eat it feels like something bubbles up my throat, and I think it's affecting my throat too? As it feels kind of irritated/weird.

So the Botox basically makes it so you can burp, and that solves stuff like acid reflux and other symptoms?

Title    : Do anyone else choke drinking water?

Just tried to chug water from a bottle and choked on it, it was almost like my throat closed up and I was gasping for 15-20 seconds.

Just had a scary thing happen when I drank a sip of milk straight from the carton and it was like my throat seized up? 

I could breath but barely, and felt like I was choking on something? If that makes sense.

It felt like some part in my throat got stuck and blocked everything. It pretty quickly went away, but it was scary..

It's happened once it twice before, but not as severe I think. I usually choke on my drink if is from a bottle, or of I accidentally drink too fast.

I have a lot of acid reflux that comes with my micro burps and it’s hard to eat or drink anything. And even when I do successfully eat some food I feel like I’m regurgitating it for hours after and it’s miserable. Did you have trouble swallowing? When did you start feeling back to normal?

This is a great day to day update. I got my procedure done with Dr Bastian 4 days ago, and the reflux and saliva buildup is what has bothered me the most so I haven’t felt comfort eating solid foods yet because I get nervous swallowing and feeling that choking feeling. I was patient 182 he said and so far most all that have gotten the procedure done by him have said it’s all worth it, it’s just the first few days are discouraging because it’s so uncomfortable. Even water feels like it starts coming back when I burp after I drink it. I’m sticking to eating mostly protein shakes and started taking some acid reflux pills to help the acid no come up as often. I’m trying to stay positive that I made the right choice and this will be the change I needed in my life. I already feel so much better bloating wise so I have high hopes.

I am on day 6 after my procedure and my biggest discomfort is the swallowing issue. A lot of the time I burp when I swallow so the food or drink is pushed back up from the burp which gives me a choking sensation. I have a lot of micro burps as well and I can’t control them at all yet. I haven’t tried fizzy drinks yet because I’m still trying to master swallowing water normally. I have been wanting to go to the gym but am  afraid of all the air you intake from like running that I’ll burp a bunch there or even worse choke on a burp and freak out. What Dr did you go to to get the procedure done?

Selftext :
2 days ago I had a really rough time all day. I still haven’t eaten much so I was losing energy. I couldn’t get food to go down without panicking so I was getting very frustrated. And then yesterday started off ok, tired but was still improving on my liquid swallowing more. I had been craving Mac and cheese for days so I finally went out and got me some. Made sure it was cooked very well and cheesy to help it go down. I say on my porch in the fresh air which helped me relax so I didn’t panic and I had small bites. It’s still a struggle and I have to eat slow and let one spoon full go down fully before the next but I successfully ate it. Not all but enough to kick up my energy and made me feel a lot better. I ate early enough so I didn’t lay down for a few hours after so I didn’t feel acid reflux in bed later. Still a ways to go but this is definitely getting better

I am finally starting to feel like myself again. I got week 3 on Wednesday and I have been able to eat a little more. Better with solids I just need to remember to chase with water still. I tried a salad for the first time today and it was a lot easier than I thought. I thought since it was a bunch of different veggies the texture would be harder to swallow but it was a lot better than expected. I still take the acid reflux pills because that is still a bit of an issue and I have to eat early or else I feel a lot of acid come up when I lay down to go to bed. Overall thought I have been burping a lot, no bloat, finally had some soda and got some good strong burps. Still not much control but i do feel relief more now when I do burp!

I got the Botox a little over 3 weeks ago and by no means am a singer professionally but I do love to sing in the car and shower and stuff. What I did notice is I feel out of breath a lot quicker lately still. It’s getting better but I can’t hold a note too long without needing to take a deep breath again. But I figure it’s temporary because since the throat is so relaxed and open with the Botox, when I try and sing, the air comes out a lot faster so I can’t hold a note for too long. But I do feel like that would fade with time

I did get very anxious due to the hard swallowing so it’s been a bit tougher for me to get back to normal but it’s progress and the burping is in full effect but all my symptoms of pain and bloat have disappeared

It was a rough first few weeks and not just physically but mentally. For the past 2 weeks or so I have finally been able to eat almost anything as long as I still take smaller bites and drink water after each bite. I can finally chug some good drinks of sparkling water and get deep good burps. I also still burp randomly which I’m taking as a good sign that it’s not fading and hopefully won’t. If I raise my voice or laugh hard I do accidentally burp which is still embarrassing but it’s worth it because all my pain and discomfort from before literally disappeared the day after my procedure. I still haven’t gotten the courage to eat lunch at work with my co workers because I don’t want to be that awkward one making weird burping noises after every bite while everyone tries to enjoy their meals. I know a lot of it now is in my head and I just need to do it and get used to it but it’s taking times. I also tried acupuncture a few times for my anxiety and it did seem to help me relax and not be so freaked out about eating. On the plus side, I lost 20lbs, not in the best way but now that they are gone I want to keep working out to keep them off hopefully and with the bloating feeling gone I feel like it’s easier to workout, even though I’m burping up a storm the whole time I’m running. Overall great choice to have done this procedure with Dr. Bastian and can’t thank him enough. I hope it sticks and if anyone knows of any other things I can do to make sure it doesn’t fade away and I can still fully burp after the Botox wears off please let me know. I’m practicing with drinking bubbly drinks at least 2 drinks a day. 

Anyone who hasn’t had the procedure and is thinking about getting it down, I 100% recommend it. I personally would recommend Dr Bastian since he is the one who started it and is prob the best at it as well. Please feel free to give any advice or ask any questions :)

Yes I had gone to the doctor multiple times and they thought I might have IBS and on other occasions my doctor had also given me acid reflux pills for stomach discomfort but I assumed I had that because I love spicy foods. All my symptoms have gone away! The acid reflux is still there a bit but when I talked to Dr Bastian on my follow up and he said the reflux i have now is from the Botox and how once I eat and burp I get this acidic taste in my mouth but that will fade once the Botox fades. It had gotten better but all my IBS symptoms have disappeared. The cramps, the bloat, the gas, everything is gone, it’s crazy!

I’m pretty sure I got 50units. Did you get your procedure done by Dr.Bastian? That is my biggest fear, having to go back to do it again. My experience was so rough st the beginning that I wouldn’t want to go through it again. But I started burping right away and have been burping like non stop since which he said was a good sign even tho it’s embarrassing. And I drink at least 2 bubbly waters a day and practice pricing burps.

Yes good luck! So were you able to get any relief and burps at all after your first procedure? Are you going to the same doctor? Maybe you needed a higher dosage. It’s a rough recovery for a bit but all worth it, I just hope my sticks as well after the 3 months

Oh no, that’s horrible... yeah I had micro burps the day after and after the first week louder but very uncontrollable burps. Now sometimes I burp so loud I freak myself out but I must say the relief it comes with is nothing I had ever felt before. I know it’s TMI but it’s crazy what I had been missing out on all my life and I just assumed everyone felt bloated all the time to some degree

Not the only one out there with this. And that it has a cure! It’s always been super embarrassing telling people I couldn’t burp because everyone looked at me like I was crazy or faking it. I know I just get too inside my head fearing it won’t stick, I just need to let go and enjoy the relief, and keep practicing to train my body.

That happened to me a few times also and one time I think I took too big of a bite and I felt it get kinda stuck so I drank water and tried to clear my throat and it came all the way out. It was bad but that o my happened once. I just made sure I took small bites and drank a good amount of water in between. I also had smaller meals because since our throats are like limp if we burp and the food hasn’t gone down enough it will be pushed back. But that slowly starts going away with time. Just drink plenty of water after your meals

Oh I know that upside down feeling and it freaked me out. I bent over a few time to even just grab something from the fridge and all the sudden I felt stomach acid and if I had just eat or drank the food come rushing back up into my mouth and nose and I would shoot back up and feel like crap. I started taking acid reflux pills which have helped with that so the stomach acid doesn’t come back up as much. I was told that my bottom esophageal sphincter is prob loosened up due to the fact that I haven’t been able to burp and the air has always needed to make its way back down my throat. Dr Bastian said that would go away with time also but that acid reflux pills would help. He also said to eat early and not lay down, and stay up straight for a while after I eat to make sure that doesn’t happen. All the side effects suck and I keep getting told they would fade with time. Which 6 weeks later most are gone now.

Yeah I went back to work the Monday after my procedure and I worked a few hours and then worked from home that day and the next. I just wasn’t ready and had not anticipated it being so uncomfortable. And it did feel really hard for a bit but in retrospect after comparing how I feel now to how I felt before the procedure, totally worth it. Also I feel like I had a little longer and tougher recovery because I got so much anxiety. I felt like a lot people I talked to on here had a bit easier time. So I guess it all kind of depends on the person. I’m hoping your recovery is shorter and quicker.

That’s how many I drink now so I’ll have to up my drinks. I still burp like crazy like randomly if I raise my voice or laugh to hard or after random bites of food. I ha r more control over it now and turning my head to the right helps push it out more. I had a really hard time with the swallowing early on for like a month straight that idk if I could go through it all over again.

The idea is that with the Botox you re teach your throat to relax when air needs to come out so after your surgery you have those 3-6 months to practice and as it slowly fades it becomes muscle memory and once the Botox wears off the ability sticks... I just got my 3 months after surgery and I still have the ability, it is more controlled and not as random but that is my worst fear, because I had a rough recovery with the inability to swallow properly after. But I drink 3-4 bubbly drinks a day now to get as much practice as possible

Title    : I hit my 6 months after my procedure with Dr Bastian yesterday and I couldn’t be happier!!!
Selftext :
6 months ago I flew to Chicago from California with the hopes of finally being able to confirm a diagnosis and hopefully a cure. Dr Bastian was amazing and made me feel better about it all. On July 24th I went in and it all happened so fast and then it was done and I was ready to burp. Sadly I had a rough day after of anxiety because I couldn’t even swallow water and I kept chocking. And the. The first 2 months after I was miserable, re-learning to do the basics like swallowing water and eating tiny bites of food. I’m not going to lie it was one of the hardest 2 months of my adult life because I wasn’t expecting it to be this tough. But once I got the hang of eating and drinking slower I started to be me again, plus all the micro uncontrollable burps that had started right after the procedure. The burps were so hard to control and happened after I ate anything which was kinda embarrassing. I drank a La Croix 2 a day, everyday and still do just to be sure it stuck. After I hit like 3 months I was finally able to eat and drink like normal just as long as I took smaller bites cause I did have the occasional choke. But my burping was getting more controlled and all my stomach pain and bloating had disappeared. I still worried if I stopped drinking bubbly water it would go away so I made sure 2 everyday. I also started enjoying the occasional beer and loved being able to drink more than one and not feel like I was going to pop. 
Overall it was the worst and best experience of my life so far and I honestly feel like my life had changed dramatically and I’m so much happier. No more bloat and pain. I thank Dr Bastian for everything he did to help me live a better life honestly. We are rare us non burpers but as of yesterday I am happy to report I am now an official burper! 

I hope anyone who is considering it make the choice to go through with it. It won’t be easy but in the end it will be amazing!

I don’t remember exactly how much I had... I’ll have to check, but I got really bad anxiety because I didn’t expect the trouble swallowing to be as tough as it was and had a panic attack the first time I tried eating and after that I think I was just anxious to just try. But all the struggle had been worth it because I feel amazing! Not more bloat, cramps, discomfort, anything. It’s crazy how fast it worked

Yes try not to panic... I did and became very anxious about the fear of choking so my swallowing issues were bad for 2 months. But once I got it out of my head that I was going to choke and took tiny bites I got better. But once the side effects faded the results are Amazing!!!

Title    : A Triathlete Can't Burp & Is Terrified Of Throwing Up
Selftext :
So happy to have found this forum. I have been doing research on this for a few months now.  Long story short I haven't been able to burp for years but day to day it doesn't cause huge problems for me - sometimes I gurgle and feel bloated and I fart a a lot but other than that I generally feel I can continue to live with the issue.  I also have a fear of throwing up and have not thrown properly up for 35 years!

What is bothering me the most is when I compete in triathlon races above a certain distance the inability to burp often leads to me having to pull out of the race.  I get extremely bloated, pains in my stomach and feel extremely nauseous but of course am unable to throw up or even burp to let the air out.

I have signed up for a full Ironman in April and was planning to adjust my nutrition and hope to get through it, but now I have found there is a solution I am certainly considering the Botox treatment.  I am based in Arkansas, and called Dr Bastin in Chicago - looks like I can get in there end of Feb.  My race is April so not sure if that is giving me enough time?  Would love feedback from anyone who has been through this. Also any Drs closer to Arkansas. Would be especially keen to here from any athletes who experienced similar problems when exercising for a long duration or at a certain intensity.

Thanks!

Title    : Post Op Recovery/Side Effects
Selftext :
I am considering scheduling surgery with Dr Bastian March 12th, however I have an Ironman Race scheduled 4 weeks after it. The main reason I am getting surgery is to enable me to successfully complete an Ironman or long endurance race. I’ve discovered that high intensity exercise for 10+ hours while consuming nutrition to get you through it and not being able to burp is pretty much impossible. I am concerned surgery would be too close to the race and worried I won’t be able to properly fuel my body in the 4 weeks before and won’t be able to complete the required training.

For those who have had surgery would you recommend waiting until after this race?

Other option is to try to get it done sooner with another Doctor?

Thanks,

M

I have this exact problem. I hve attempted and failed 3 Ironman events. 2 x 70.3 and one full. I finished one of them after walking the full run and ending up extremely dehydrated. I can successfully complete up to olympic distance but anything further same things happens. It usually kicks in half way through the bike. I get to the point where I cannot consume any more nutrition and end up with all of the effects you describe and dehydration. This doesn’t tend to happen on indoor trainer rides and only sometimes happens on outdoor distance rides (outside of race). I have tried many different hydration and nutrition products. Last time I went 100% natural with maple syrup and salt in my water, and mashed potatoes and salt as my fuel source. Didn’t work. I am scheduled for surgery Sept 13th as wanted to get all of my summer short distance triathlons done first. If successful I will attempt another ironman in November. I am very nervous about surgery though.

Title    : Covid Right After Botox

Has anyone caught Covid during their recovery? I tested positive for Covid yesterday (day 3 after Botox). Yesterday I didn’t feel too bad but really struggling today. It really hurts to cough, every time I cough burps pop out. Finding it difficult to drink water due to slow swallow and a lot of mucous. 

On a positive the procedure seemed to work as I am burping lots, just struggling with combined post procedure symptoms and Covid symptoms.

Unlikely many people will have been in same situation, but throwing it out there just in case anyone has any advice.

Title    : Post Botox Week 1 Day by Day Diary
Selftext :
I had Botox under GA last Wednesday with Dr Bastian and thought I would share my journey so far while it is fresh in my head.

Day 1 (Wednesday) - Botox day - coming out of the procedure I felt super tired with a sore throat. I had a short at the hotel before heading to the airport. At the airport I drank a smoothie, and then a bowl of pasta. Absolutely no issues swallowing and very little pain. I ate a normal dinner when I got home that night.

Day 2 (Thursday) - Slept well and woke up with a sore. Ate some breakfast and maybe felt some super mild slow swallow - not sure if it was really there at that point or if I was just imagining and hoping it was starting. Decided to go for a short walk around lunch time and took a can of sparkling water with me. Was sipping on it as I walked and out came a small burp - I also caught this on video and was super surprised and excited. A few more micro burps came out throughout the day. In the evening I went for a 2 mile run and some more burps popped out while I was running. Slow swallow was there by the evening but not too bad at all - still ok eating normal food.

Day 3 (Friday) - lots of microburps throughout the day. Went out for dinner at night and drank some sparkling wine and a little beer - which triggered lots of little burps. Friends were trying to teach me how to burp but whatever I was doing was not controllable. Burps every time i laughed, coughed. Managed to eat a chicken sandwich for dinner - slow swallowing there but easily resolved with water.

Day 4 (Saturday) - had a terrible sleep the night before. Super restless and uncomfortable when lying down. Tried to prop myself up more with pillows but didn’t help much. Got up in the morning and still decided to run 5 mile. Run felt ok but stopped more than I normally would. Was hard to drink water and breath normally - due to water taking longer to go down. I ate some pizza later on and felt like I was going to choke - had to remind myself it was in the right hole, and eat very slowly. Microburps now uncontrollable and coming out when i cough, laugh, sneeze and sometimes even when I talk.  Also now able to bring a burp on pretty easily - after food or water by putting my chin downwards and moving my head to the left. Can taste food when burp and also a bit of afraid of throwing up.

Day 5 (Sunday) - another terrible sleep. Struggled to swallow saliva. Started to feel congested so decided to do a Covid test. It was positive - ugh! So now dealing with Covid symptoms and post botox combined. Decided to rest properly since I also had Covid. Eating and even drinking water was a real struggle due to slow swallowing. Burps happening alot (probably too much) and seemed a bit bigger than the micro burps - not huge though and still not able to control.

Day 6 (Monday) - stayed off work and in bed mainly due to Covid. Chest felt very tight - again due to Covid. No sore throat, but voice hoarse - i presume due to Covid. Major struggles eating and drinking. Bubbles/micro burps coming back up even with sipping water.

Day 7 (Tuesday) - symptoms very similar to day 5. Decided to shift to soup, ice-cream, yoghurt and smoothies today. Who knew eating yoghurt would be so difficult. Did a few virtual work calls and burps would often escape when i spoke. Glad I was not in the office in person.

For those who experienced this, how long did it last? I am a triathlete and runner - normally running up to 30 miles per week. I am 10 days post botox and unable to run 1 mile right now without having to stop and rest my breathing - feel like I am gasping for air.

I ran the first few days after botox and felt ok. Seems to once the botox kicked in it got worse.

Yes!! I am 3.5 weeks post botox and experiencing this a lot too. It also happens when i hold my nose and blow like when I am trying to unblock ear pressure, when I am lifting weights as well as just generally throughout the day. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if it was in or out. I am also having trouble breathing properly when running and think it’s because when I am trying to breath air in it is also going down my esophagus.

I caught Covid during my recovery - i tested positive less that a week after getting the injection. I don’t think that helped with my recovery either. I also seek to be taking a lot of air in - the ear popping thing is causing air to go down my esophagus also.

Yes! 100% been there through both my pregnancies - at the I did not know I had RCPD but obviously knew I couldn’t vomit and had terrible emetephobia. I lost a lot of weight and became terribly dehydrated. I couldn’t eat or drink much at all and although I wasn’t throwing up I was dry heaving (now known as air vomiting) multiple times a day. I had to get IV fluids several times due to dehydration. To be honest I am not sure I explained too much the inability to throw up. It felt like I was throwing up when I was dry heaving just nothing was coming out. I found that Zofran did not work for me but what did work was best for me was a combination of Unisom and Vitamin B6.

Title    : Excessive air in esophagus post Botox
Selftext :
1 month post botox and I have a crazy amount of air in my esophagus all the time. I am doing bug burps that provide relief but the relief they provide is further down. I constantly feel like I have a lump/bubble in my throat. If i put my chin down or move my head to the left or right (motion to make myself burp) the air bubbles pop out but it’s literally a constant flow. It’s like they pop out and more air goes in. I am making myself burp so much to try and clear it that sometimes throw up is coming up in my mouth which I hate. 

Any tips, ideas for relief and will this get better?

Title    : Almost 7 weeks post Botox and still swallowing too much air
Selftext :
Post botox symptoms have lasted way longer than expected. Definitely getting a but easier but I am still having issues:
* Still swallowing lots of air when talking, eating and drinking.
* Still having difficulties running at a fast lace as when I breath quickly too much air is going down my esophagus and not enough is going in to my wind pipe - leaving me short of breath and feeling unfitter than I should be and was before botox.
* Still have excessive flatulence as well as being able burp - pretty sure it’s because so much air is going in
* Not able to drink much fizzy alcohol - like prosecco or beer. I was able to do this pre botox. Only had issues and needed to air vomit when I drank way too much. Right now I am struggling with 2 glasses.
* Feeling of air bubbles in my throat and constant need to burp when this happens - normally most days in the evening after dinner.

Would love to hear from others who have experienced these issues who are further along than me. Any tips on how to make this better/easier while I wait for the botox to wear off?

Yes I am experiencing this. I am 7 weeks post botox and have a marathon in 10 weeks. I have figured out some ways to manage this and have been able to get my weekly training miles in, however, at a slower pace than I would normally run. For me it seems like when my breathing becomes labored (when running fast) some air is going down the esophagus and not enough is going down my wind puff in to my lungs. I have been told by Dr Bastian’s PA that it should start to get better soon.

Like already mentioned it seems to vary by person. I am distance triathlete/runner. Currently training for Marathon in 10 weeks. I got Botox 7 weeks ago and I have struggled initially and things are not totally normal for me yet.

I ran 5 miles the day after Botox with no issues at all. After about week when all of the other symptoms kicked in I really struggled - got short of breath very quickly and had to stop after less than a mile. This was very worrying for me. I didn’t want to take a break from my training so decided to try and get my miles in but running at a much slower pace than normal. By week 3 I was back to running about 30 miles a week, and week 4 up to 40. However, my paces were 2-3 min/mile slower than normal. I had to really try to focus on breathing in through my nose and out through my mouth.

I have now re introduced speed and intervals. My breathing is still not great - it sound louder than it ever did before and I don’t feel like I could do a super fast 5k right now. 

I followed up with Bastian and have had two follow up appts with his Physician’s Assistant relating to this as running is a big part of my life. They believe that because my body has reacted so well to the botox - the muscle is very lose right now and rather than the air I am breathing in all going down my wind pipe, air is also going in to my esophagus. I am pretty sure this is happening as I am also burping a lot when running and after. They keep reassuring me that it will get better as the botox starts to wear off.

I have not come across many people who have experienced this so hopefully you are ok. I hope all goes well tomorrow and please keep me posted on how things go for you.

Title    : (help!) hiatal hernia, horrible gurgle sensation, can't burp .. but if I could, I think I'd feel much better
Selftext :
Hi, 

I'm (29M) new here and trying to better understand what I'm going through so I appreciate any feedback!

About 3 months ago I had a scope that identified a hiatal hernia.  Over the last 2 years, I've been having difficulty with my esophagus.  After almost any meal, and especially after drinking beer or coffee, I get this horrible gurgle sensation.  At it's worse, I feel like throwing up.  When I do throw up, nothing actually comes out, besides a burp.  Now unfortunately I am completely unable to burp on my own.  Doctors have me taking different prescriptions (Domperidone, Iberogast) and undergoing dietary changes, however, nothing seems to work.  I THINK that if I could burp, I would feel 10000% better.  But I can't on command..

Has anyone experiences something similar?  If so, what did you do?! I'm really struggling over here!

Thanks in advance!

Title    : How do I convince my doctor to get botox? (as a Canadian)
Selftext :
Hi, 

I'm 99% sure that I have R-CPD.  I had an endoscopy last October that confirmed a hiatal hernia.  Medications and life changes didn't solve the problem.

I'm going to go back to my family doctor and my GI doctor and present this botox option.  Im not sure how they will take it but I do think it's my next step.

Has anyone been in this position?  Any suggestions of how I can convince my doctors of this botox surgery?

Also, as a Canadian, I've read it's more difficult to get the surgery done in Canada .. do any fellow Canadians have any alternative suggestions?

​

Appreciate any feedback!

Title    : Do incidental/unexpected burps count?
Selftext :
My whole life ive never really let out a true burp, and I’ve certainly never been able to force one out or predict when one will happen. I burp unexpectedly, and very briefly (like if my mouth is open or I’m talking) maybe once a month? Can this still be rcpd? I fit all the other symptoms- extreme bloating, gas, sharp intakes that I can’t control that are sort of hiccups but not, and gurgling that has gotten out of hand within the last year, but has been happening for at least four years.

Title    : any luck with gastroenterologist?
Selftext :
I brought up my persistent gas issues with my doctor and she referred me to a gastroenterologist. I have been reading about rcpd and browsing this sub and many of you say don’t bother with gastroenterologist, go straight to an ENT. I didn’t want to argue with my doctor, as this was my first time ever seeing her, but I know I have to advocate for myself more. My question is, has anyone had a good experience with a gastroenterologist? I really don’t want to have to go through years of unnecessary tests and referrals when I’m pretty sure I have rcpd.

Title    : need to vent!
Selftext :
Trying to get my RCPD diagnosed. Unfortunately, I live in a rural area where the nearest specialists (as in, ENTs) are located an hour’s drive away, and the nearest specialist who is documented to know about RCPD is a six hour drive away. Talked to my primary care doctor abt my symptoms, she referred me to a gastroenterologist (a PEDIATRIC gastroenterologist, nonetheless, though they treat up to 26) and said to eat more vegetables. Went to the gastro today and was basically immediately dismissed, she touched my stomach and told me I am very constipated (not unusual for me, I’ve never been ‘regular’ my whole life but it doesn’t bother my stomach/cause pain) and that I need to start eating more fiber and she prescribed miralax. I brought up the fact that I can’t burp, and my throat is constantly gurgling and that my abdomen isn’t really the issue, and she dismissed this as reflux stemming from constipated. I just said whatever, I’ll try it just to rule it out. Came home and realized she wanted me to take 15x the normal dose of miralax and said absolutely no way! I have a job, I can’t be shitting myself constantly. I drink a LOT of water, eat very healthy, and consume a fair amount of fiber every day, and I don’t feel constipated, I simply just don’t have to go every day. So I immediately started googling ENTs near me, and found one within a half hour of my house. However, he died unexpectedly last year and the practice is now closed! 
How did everyone find a specialist who knows about RCPD? And has anyone had luck informing their doctor of this condition and actually being listened to?

Title    : burping... bad?
Selftext :
So a few months ago I was convinced I had rcpd- I had all the symptoms including only small, occasional burps, severe bloating and discomfort, and nonstop gurgling and chest pressure after eating. I went to doctors and was told I was constipated, needed to eat more fiber, take omeprazole... None of that helped, but about a month ago I did the shaker exercises a few times (literally a FEW, maybe on five different occasions) and now I burp constantly. Like big, uncomfortable burps. At least twenty times after dinner, which has always been my worst meal. 

This has not solved my problem, as my main issue was the social anxiety that came with the loud gurgling; now I am just burping uncontrollably and loudly all the time, which is arguably worse and causes me more anxiety. I haven't really noticed a change in bloating, either. What is happening, and did I even have RCPD in the first place??

They are usually quite massive after a meal; 2-3 loud ones that provide immediate relief, and then I spend the rest of the day kind of hiccup-burping, more like chest spasms ? That gets pretty uncomfortable to the point where I'd rather still be gurgling. But yeah if not for the social aspect, I'd say the ability to burp has helped slightly more than hindered

Title    : Post Botox updated and questions on progress
Selftext :
Hey all,

Had Botox with dr Rosen at UCSF 9 days ago. Figured I’d give a brief day by day and check in with others on my progress

Day 0-2: slight sore throat. Microburps started at night of day 2. Slight slow swallow. 

Day 2-4: sore throat gone, slow swallow setting in. It’s really not a big deal but certainly need water to eat most foods. 

Day 4-9: first large burps, but only when I turn my head to the side. I typically get these burps within a few minutes after meals and they last for up to 10 seconds! Honestly amazing. But they only happen when my head is turned fully to either side. I still get the gurgles if I’m looking head on.

Is this sounding normal to folks? I’d love to work on getting burps out looking straight. They do happen with a cough/yawn/sneeze head on. 

Overall though the procedure was really chill and side effects minimal!

Skip your GP if possible and call a doctor who knows about RCPD directly. If you have all big 4 the RCPD symptoms it’s extremely highly likely you have Rcpd. That said, and just to cover my ass, it’s possible your GP noticed something else that the gastro could help with, so do your due diligence. But when it comes to RCPD, you don’t have to go through all of that. 

If you’re near SF, I had luck cold calling dr Clark Rosen’s office at ucsf. The receptionist who answered the phone knew what I was talking about immediately when I said RCPD. No referral needed.

I’m 12 days out right now so can only share my experience but as mentioned it varies!

I was just wiped from the anesthesia the next day and had some irritation from the way they gave my oxygen in my nose so was super sneezy, but was able to do my WFH job the next day. 

As for side effects, my throat was sore for like 24 hours but really low key. They had me alternating Tylenol and advil and that did a great job. Slow swallow set in after a day or two at that is still around. Thankfully for me it’s really not bad. It just feels like the food sometimes gets stuck in your upper throat, and the littlest bit of water makes it go down fine. It’s certainly odd but so not as bad as I expected. I could eat everything I normally ate just some of it (like bread) absolutely needed water. Overall very chill!

Lots of us here have and for near 100% it’s the right decision. Reach out to an ENT and check the list on the subreddit for doctors who may be near you that do the procedure. Also confirm you have the big 4 symptoms - if you have all 4, it’s almost certain that rcpd is the cause (bloating/feeling full or pressure in chest or stomach, gurgle sounds from throat, excess flatulence, no burping).

I am so happy I got it and it was so easy!! The wholething is fast and the side effects for me were really not bad at all. The slow swallowing symptom was not a problem - I just had to have water nearby when I was eating anything particularly dry. I also had a very slightly sore throat for maybe 24 hours. I’m a bit over a month out and have not had any choking symptoms and the slow swallow is totally gone. I haven’t had any issues with throwing up, but one time I bent over looking straight down and has a little regurgitation but nothing came out. My life is improved so much! Going out with friends and getting drinks is doable, moving around after eating a big meal is doable without lying down, the croaking sounds are almost entirely gone. 

This procedure has been done for years and is very safe. The only serious side effects my doctor mentioned were perhaps scratching your throat or chipping a tooth, but it’s extremely rare. And any side effects in swallowing will go away as the Botox wears off and will get better. 

Please ask any direct questions if you have and id be happy to answer.

I think you should speak with the doctor who would do the procedure for you. For reasons not totally understood, a significant majority of people have a permanent fix after just one Botox dose, even after the Botox wears off. For a small set of people, a second dose is needed and then it’s near 100% permanent. Of course, some folks need a third but very rare.

I also suggest watching the dr bastion FAQ videos on YouTube. They really helped me!

Don't stress. It will probably get a little worse over the next week, but just remember to go slow, have water, and that if the food is stuck you are NOT CHOKING. And no matter how annoying it gets, it will eventually get better and you'll have relief from burping. I found that no matter how stuck it felt like the food was, even the smallest bit of water made everything go down. I avoided super dry foods like straight bread for the first few weeks

DO IT. obviously your experience may vary but I can only speak for myself and the data I’ve seen. My procedure was so chill. Doctor was great, going under was easy and I don’t even remember most of it, side effects were minimal. I had a MILD sore throat for like 12 hours and a few days of sneezing from irritation from the oxygen tube theygave me (very rare but mild and passed in a few days). Slow swallow is weird, but for me that was it. Food went down with water and once I got used to it it was nbd and went away completely in about a month maybe less. Quality of life and eating and drinking has improved dramatically. Note that people with bad experiences are more likely to post on Reddit, so your perception of the likelihood of negative side effects is skewed.

So sorry you’re going through these things! This sounds a lot more severe than what I and I think many of us ever experienced. There is real, effective treatment now more widely available than ever. Have you checked the doctors list on this subreddit? It sounds like you should be seeking treatment immediately. Go right to an ENT from the list. 

I also suggest, if you aren’t already, seeking mental health help. We all should be doing it anyway and there’s no shame in it. The condition is significantly worsened in my experience by anxiety, and anxiety and the gut are directly related and could be contributing to other issues making things worse.

I would’ve endured so so so much of a worse recovery (and it wasn’t even bad to begin with) to have this life now. It is amazing how fast your body gets used to things. The weird swallowing is odd for a little bit but very quickly becomes nothing more than a minor inconvenience. 

And trust me, when you have your first burp, you’re gonna feel so good it will all be worth it right away.

This doesn't seem worrying to me! The weeks and months after botox was a total roller coaster. THere were days I thought I had it 100% and others when I thought it was totally gone. You're looking for a general upward trend in your ability to burp. If you notice it's totally gone for many days in a row it's worth checking in with your doc. But you'll have ups and downs with gradually more ups! It wasn't until several months in that I was really confident I had it down. My side effects were extremely minimal and I'm almost a year out now and doing great. 

  
Agree with others and keep practicing with fizzy water.

Selftext :
After finding out about this niche community and rare dysfunction, i’ve made it my mission to self-cure and learn how to burp properly.

Now, I do see myself being in the kinda severe side of the spectrum. Ive never really been able to burp (i have tiny microburps like a handful of times a year). I don’t even remember if I could as a child, all I know is that the symptoms that we now know as RCPD started years ago when my anxiety was out of control. (I’ve been anxious ever since I was little, so the correlation of a very tense body and RPCD seems probable).

Anyways skip the rambling, I want to learn how to self-cure because I KNOW I CAN BURP. I’ve done it before, I did a micro one last night. It’s just the matter of making these painful gurgles come to life in their burp form.

So please, if anyone has anything to help (I cannot do air vomiting I have long nails LOL) please feel free, anything will help!!! (note: i’m trying to keep in mind the swallowing trick so any tricks to help with that too!)

Selftext :
I am beyond frustrated at this point. I’ve had these symptoms for almost 10 years now and last year I went to the doctor thinking I had acid reflux (did a bunch of blood tests and ended up with a Dexilant prescription for a month). 

Today I went back to the doctors in hopes of getting a referral to a gastroenterologist or an ENT…ended up with ANOTHER PPI prescription (and had to push for a referral to see a gastroenterologist).

I’m telling them that I don’t think I have acid reflux and I think I have RCPD and they still believe that it’s acid reflux that is causing “spasms” in my throat.

and if you’re wondering; yes I check off every symptom for RCPD.

Title    : Just wanted coffee (rant)
Selftext :
so i never drink coffee (for obvious reasons), and i don’t think i’ve had a coffee in months, maybe almost a year. i genuinely never drink it.

but today, i really needed an energy pick me up…so i had a coffee.

welp what do you know…frog mode activated.

god why do caffeine croaks hurt the most. i envy the people who can have a coffee every once and awhile. relying on my body’s energy is EXHAUSTING.

Title    : Mistaken IBS?
Selftext :
Hi - just discovered this after a nutritionist told me to see a specialist for it. I’ve been treated for IBS/mystery bloating for five years. In agony with bloating every day, some days I can barely function with how intense it is. I do think I fit the criteria but can you not burp at all? I never really do but will have what feels like a microburp very occasionally, I often feel the need to burp but can’t. 

Anyone else here diagnosed with ibs only to find out it’s this?

Can you have this if you burp occasionally? Anyone fall into that category? My ENT said I could do the Botox if I wanted to but she said I don’t have all the classic symptoms. I don’t like that she’s leaving it up to me to decide. 

I have: 
- extreme bloating, very painful and constant 
- violent hiccups, feeling like about to burp sometimes the don’t 
- gurgling 
- small burps maybe handful times a day 
- occasional pressure chest

Title    : Need some motivation
Selftext :
Diagnosis was confirmed. I got the shot by Dr. Bastion himself 12 days ago. I’ve been burping but I think a lot of them are only after I inhale air leaving a lot of the air in my abdomen in place. Bloating has gotten worse and I’m barely hanging on. I know I have give it more time but I’m wicked nervous as that 2 week mark approaches. I’d do anything to have the abdominal bloat and extreme pain go down. A lot of the time I can only burp if I look right and then straight again which is weird but I’ll take it. I keep seeing all these posts about feeling better before the two week mark, someone please tell me longer is fine haha

I’m two weeks from my shot with Dr. Bastion. I’m sure part of it is nerves, but has anyone noticed bloating getting worse? I’ve already had severe bloating issues but I feel like I’m sucking air in and it’s going to my abdomen. Im in some of the worst pain in a long time. I’m burping when I turn my head to the right and back straight, sometimes even a real burp. Has anyone has this issue? Dr. Bastion said it might take longer than 2 weeks, did any of you not get relief from bloating until after that point?

Did you try to treat these? I’m only two weeks out from my shot and burping but no relief (bloating is pure agony). GI diagnosed me with pelvic floor disorder and I’m starting PT, he also suggested breathing techniques for  APD (diaphragm thing). I’m want to make sure I’m going down the right track, and after 6 years at least the RCPD diagnosis starts that. Hoping a month or two out from the shot will be different.

Title    : Worse Bloating Post Injection
Selftext :
Anyone have their bloating symptoms get worse after the injection? I’m just over two weeks out so I’m hoping it’s temporary. I normally have pretty bad bloating but can kind of function most days. Since the injection I’ve been so bloated that I feel like I’m going to pass out from the pain. My abdomen is the most distended it’s ever been. I am burping but only when I turn my head right and I can hear air being sucked in so I think the burping I am doing is more just expelling air that’s going in not from my abdomen. I know I have a few more weeks but I’m trying to figure out why I’d feel worse. I can still feel trapped burps so I know it hasn’t kicked in yet.

So I’m 7 weeks out from my Botox shot. I am burping a good amount still but only when I turn my head to the side for the most part.

For people who have had success with a second Botox shot, did the first one do anything for you? The first had led to some burping but I’ve had no abdominal relief. It seems like everything I read on second shots working is that the first worked (burping and abdominal relief) to some extent and wore off. 

I’m wondering since it did not relief any symptoms the first time around if I’m different from these situations.

Title    : Second Shot this week
Selftext :
I have my second shot with Doctor Bastion this week. I had the first one three months ago with some success burning but no abdminal relief. (100 units) 

I was told I’d be getting 150 units this time up from 100. However this is Dr. Bastions first time going above 125 and the third time any doctor at his place has gone above that value. I am also only 3 months out and definitely have some Botox left in my from the occasional burp (when I turn my head). 

My local ENT is familiar with RCPD and warned me with going above 100 units. I know from posts here that a decent amount of people have. 

I’m so stressed out now that I know they’ve basically never gone higher than 125. 

If you’ve had 150, how did it go? I’m mostly concerned with long term side affects more than whether or not it works. It is Dr. Bastion so if anyone was going to do this I would trust him.

Selftext :
So I got my second shot a week ago. I am burping again and some of the burps are big. However there is no abdominal relief yet. I feel like all my burps are coming from the air in my throat and that I might be swallowing air (as evident by the increased bloating). I had one burp that came from my belly (if you can call it that, it sounded like a was summoning a demon). The same thing happened after my first shot so I’m just nervous it’s the same thing all over again. I know it’s early in and I have to be patient but I was curious to see if anyone else had this issue where you were burping but still bloated/ distended.

Title    : Botox didn’t work
Selftext :
What am I suppose to do if two shots (100 then 150) didn’t work? My symptoms have increased dramatically and I’m even burping a decent amount but I’m so much more bloated and in so much pain. Most of the burps I think are from me drawing air in and then out while the rest remains in my abdomen. My GI says he can’t find anything wrong and that he’s not even sure if I have IBS as well. All my symptoms fit RCPD and my response to the shot shows that this is probably my main issue. For the first time in my life I’m struggling to do mundane tasks and make it through the day and it’s all because I’m so bloated. 


Anyone try anything else besides shaker exercises? I’ve been in pain for years and always held off on pain killers but for the first time ever I’m wondering if I’ll need them to work.

What am I suppose to do if both shots failed? My distention has gotten so out of control that I’m having trouble working, I’ve lost all semblance of a social life, and I can barely sleep. The gurgling/ throat bubble is back and more intense than ever. I’ve actually started to see stars because the pain is so intense. I’m in my 7th GI and honestly they have nothing. 

I’ve lived with this for years, I was miserable but could function - go to work, workout and sleep. Now I struggle to do all of those things. 
My PCP and GI are pushing pain pills which I’ve always stayed away from - but for the first time I’m considering them just so I can keep working.

I managed to find the super rare possibility where I am burping but I’m more bloated and distended than ever. Idk if I have another GI issue but I also know the shots (had 150 on Feb also) kind of worked but not fully as I still have the “ball in throat feeling” , more constipation, more bloating. It stinks because that was a lot of money too.

Title    : Something else going on?
Selftext :
I have been diagnosed with this and have had two Botox shots which did not provide any relief. Recently my symptoms have been getting worse. I’m so bloated and in so much pain I’m having trouble working, eating, sleeping, etc. I’ve always been in pain and felt limited by this but for the first time I am struggling to manage basic things. 

I hear about people who live with this for decades and I’ve accepted that might be me, but can the pain become that debilitating?  I’m been to so many GIs and other doctors, and never been diagnosed with anything (except maybe IBS).

Week 10 here, same exact situation for me. The chocking and swallowing stuff will go away as mine is almost gone. But I am still even more distended than I was before the shot and can’t for the life of me figure out why that would happen. Dr. Bastion’s office said I could be swallowing air as a result of the Botox and told me to only use a straw and to swallow food with my neck down to avoid this - but it has not made any difference. My only hope is that the Botox wears off and I stop doing this if this is the case maybe. Sorry you’re in this boat, it sucks hearing a 80% cure rate and then getting worse let alone not getting better.

They say it wears off 3-4 months so hopefully that’s the key. The only other thing that’s been suggested to me is that air inside of the intestines changes the environment and cause other things like overgrowth, but the way I see it is I’ve had air there for years while trying to figure this out. I’m kicking myself because I had the second shot exactly 3 months after the first and repeated the process. The one thing with me is that I am burping, sometimes a decent amount. But I believe they are supergastric (basically fake burps) and from air in the throat as I get 0 relief with them.

Twice since the shot I’ve had a “real” burp and felt a difference in the bloating. They said it might be supergastric burping (swallowing air and immediately burping it up).

Title    : What next?
Selftext :
Hey, I’ve had 2 Botox shots with doctor Bastion (100 and then 150 units). I’m now 4 months out from the second shot. Weirdly enough I started burping a decent amount after both shots. However, they are believed to be supergastric burps where I am just inhaling air and burping it back out without releasing much or any air from my abdomen (they don’t feel like real burps if that makes sense, I did have 1-2 actual burps after the first shot). Since the first shot my symptoms have increased dramatically - I’m at struggling to just get through the day. My abdomen sticks out so far my clothes don’t fit right, that “ball in the throat” tightness feeling is almost constant for the first time. 

How am I suppose to just go about my day when things are this bad? My PCP says painkillers might be my only options if it becomes unbearable. I’ve been in a lot of pain for 5 years but this is just crazy and the fact I’m even considering that is nonesense. 

If the shaker excerise and the shots don’t work is this it for me trying to solve this? I’ve been trying to see if I have other stomachs issues but the symptoms match RCPD so well that I think this is my main pain trigger. I’ve been trying to move on with my life but can barely function as an adult.

How bad does the pain get for you all? I’ve lived with this six years and the last few years it has definitely gotten worse. However, I find myself in excruciating abdominal pain most days now, GI says that can’t find anything. Because it comes and goes and the fact that I feel the pressure in my neck I believe it to be mainly the distention from air held. 

I’m barely functioning as an adult and I don’t know what else to do besides pain killers which have always refused. My abdomen is so swollen I feel it every time I walk, eat, etc.

Did the PT and was told I’m so distended the PT won’t work. After six years of bloating and no constipation, I’ve started to have constipation presumably from RCPD and the bloating is worse. Only advice I can give is move; excerises, walking, etc. are the only times I feel some of relief.

So I’ve had two shots (100 then 150 units) with doctor Bastion and nothing has worked. My symptoms are getting pretty dire (bloating and pain are severely limiting what I can do in a day) and I’m desperate to try other stuff. I’ve tried the shaker exercise for about 6 months and don’t think it’s helped. I’m considering trying massages (per Dr. Bastion) and acupuncture. What else is out there that could potentially help? I was told that my case is probably a really severe case and I just can’t stand to be in this much pain and this bloated 24/7 anymore. Would love any ideas or things that may have helped.

Title    : Botox Failure
Selftext :
At the end of last year I had 100 units and then a few months into this year 150 units with Dr. Bastion. Bloating, distention, and chronic pain continue to be my main issues. After the shots I did start burping and can still a little if I turn my head. I had a five month follow up. Dr. Bastion said the only way to relief the pressure was for me to get some type of tube through my nose and into my stomach  area. He was shocked when I said I don’t pass that much gas and that I wake up extremely distended every day, I’m never deflated. He said a lot of you wil start the day flat or at least pass a ton of gas to relief some pressure. He also thinks, based on the fact I don’t pass wind as much, I may also have a problem passing gas. This would make sense as lately my abdomen gets so distended I’m often missing work or unable to do much. I’ve been dealing with this for years and accepted it, but the symptoms are just out of control. And my local ENT said they can’t help further. Im constipated and my bowels just hurt from what I assume is just stretching. I’m losing control of everything in my life and just don’t know how to proceed. I burp a decent amount now some days. Every year this gets a little worse and I’m terrified of what condition I’ll be in 5 years from now. As far as I know I’m not eligible for the myotomy because I didn’t react to the shot where I got relief and then it faded. What am I suppose to do now?

For me nothing changed with the shots at all, I started burping somewhat but my symptoms did not change. However, Dr. Bastia believes RCPD still plays a big role even if it’s not the only thing.

Title    : Severe Cases
Selftext :
I’m curious to see if anyone has had this experience. I had a follow up with Doctor Bastion and he thinks I have a severe case of this seeing two injections didn’t work and my pain severity. My symptoms are out of control. The thing he was most concerned about was that I dont pass much gas either. I knew passing excessive gas was a common symptom but I wasn’t aware how much and how common it was. Do all of you pass excessive gas? I would consider me like  a an average here. He said most people wake up less bloated because they pass gas at night, I do not. I’m always severely bloated, more recently to the point of intense periods of pain. Dr. Bastion said I should try to get a tube into my abdomen to relief pressure and follow up with a GI on the lack of passing gas. Anyone else have this issue? Does everyone really pass gas that much? 

I’ve been dealing with this for years and accepted that I will be dealing with it for a long time. But I’m more or less incapacitated for periods of the day because of abdominal pain. The pressure or “ball in the throat” feeling is so severe I feel like I’m choking and can’t function. I’ve heard so many people say they lived with this for long periods of time but how am I suppose to function like this? It’s an absolute nightmare.

Anesthesia, 100 then 150 units 4 months later. Both at Bastion Voice Institute. Dr. bastion said the surgery was not likely to help (not exactly sure why) and thinks I have a severe case. He then compared me to a boy from Europe who was able to find relief with a tube vent installed down the nose and suggested I try that which did not make me happy. However, this has gotten so bad that I’m barely living so I’m just seeing if anyone is willing to try it (can’t fly back to Chicago for a 3rd time, at least not now). Although finding a RCPD doctor is hard so finding one that is willing to try something new or crazy like this is probably even harder.

Title    : Can’t even swallow my saliva
Selftext :
I've posted on here my inability to swallow since my procedure last week but today it took another turn. I can't even swallow my own saliva without feel like I am drowning and back up it comes. Has anyone else had this as severe as I am experiencing, please tell me all hope is not lost because I am regretting ever having this procedure! I did message the Bastain institute today but have not heard back.

Title    : Post Botox 4 weeks still can barely swallow 
Selftext :
I'm really struggling with not being able to swallow after having Botox 4 weeks ago. I get choked on almost everything except milkshakes and I have this tremendous buildup of saliva in my throat. It's so bad I refuse to attempt to eat in front of anyone. I've lost 27 lbs and I am so tired I have zero energy. Calling my family doctor tomorrow to see if I can get IV fluids. Anyone else struggling?

I definitely get the excessive gas! I look about 4 months pregnant after any given meal and it's super uncomfortable. I do get the single hiccups occasionally, but my main complaint with hiccups is that when I do get them, they're incredibly painful. I never understood why they hurt so much since everyone around me said hiccups don't hurt for them. I always have to be near a jar of peanut butter in case the hiccups strike. Just eat a spoonful of peanut butter or sugar and they'll disappear right away :) 

The most annoying symptom, though, is the constant gurgling. It seems to be worse when I'm laying on my left side and it goes away right away if I lay on my right side. It's definitely audible to people in adjacent rooms to the one I'm in! I'm always self conscious of this during work calls and always keep my mouse hovered over the mute button in case I feel a gurgle coming on! 

I also seem to have pretty bad reflux. I went to the doctor about a month ago to see if he would diagnose me with R-CPD. He did an endoscopy and found out I have stage C esophagitis from my reflux, along with a 1cm hiatal hernia, so he put me on a double dose of omeprazole to get it under control. I'll most likely end up checking out Dr. Bastian in Chicago if he won't address my gurgling during my next follow up appointment. 

Sorry if that was way too long of an answer, but I hope it's helpful :)

I've also had this problem! I could just brush my teeth but then my husband will ever so kindly inform me that I smell like a rotting carcass 😂 i asked the doctor about it but he didn't give any advice about it and just put me on omeprazole after my endoscopy because of my esophagitis.

You don't need this, all you need is a spoon full of peanut butter or sugar and they'll be gone instantly! I've struggled with painful hiccups my whole life and if I'm out and about and don't have access to peanut butter, I'll make an emergency grocery store run to get some. Nothing else works for me and this works every time!

Title    : Found a doctor in Wisconsin who knows about R-CPD!
Selftext :
I went to a gastroenterologist in my town and he ended up referring me to Dr. Benson Massey in Milwaukee at Froedert. I just went there today for my initial exam and I was so relieved to hear that he had heard about Bastian and R-CPD and said he has had other patients with it before! He said before he selects any treatments like Botox, he wants to do a few more tests to make sure that would be the best treatment for my specific case.

I previously had an endoscopy done in March from the first gastro and found out I had stage C esophagitis and a hiatal hernia. He put me on omeprazole 40mg once a day to get my GERD under control and prioritize healing my esophagus. Dr. Massey is scheduling a follow up endoscopy to check on how my esophagus is healing and see if my hernia has gotten any better or worse, along with increasing my omeprazole to 40mg twice a day to make sure I'm healed before that. While I'm asleep for the endoscopy, he's going to have them put the tube down my nose for a manometry test and told me to bring a soda to make sure I'm nice and gassy so he can see it in action and then he's also going to do a 24 hour ph test. 

I'll keep you guys posted, but just figured I'd share! I was so relieved he had actually heard of this before 🙂

Title    : How bad is esophageal manometry??
Selftext :
I have an upcoming endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and ph study. The doctor said that since I'll be asleep for the endoscopy anyways, they're going to insert the manometry tube while I'm out. I'm very thankful for that! I made the mistake of looking up the procedure on YouTube and it looks scary, but the comments are even worse with people saying it feels like torture. Since I'll be asleep for them putting the tube in, I think that's probably the worst part, but just curious for those of you who have had it, was it tolerable? Also has anyone done the 24 hour ph test?

Title    : Update on Wisconsin doctor
Selftext :
I just had my follow up appointment with Dr. Benson Massey in Milwaukee, WI and we went over my manometry results. He said you can clearly see the gas coming up from my stomach and then my upper sphincter tightens and the gas goes back down just to repeat the process. I'm guessing that's what's making the gurgle sound.

He recommended I get the Botox procedure done, but I keep going back and forth trying to decide if I want it. It seems like people who get it are going through hell for a few months afterwards, but reading everyone's posts it seems like they still think it's worth it and life changing. The next thing I just need to figure out is if my insurance will cover it and make sure they'll put me to sleep because I don't want to be awake for that 😂

Anyways, I'm just posting this in case there's anyone out there in the Milwaukee region of Wisconsin because it seems like this is the doctor to go to. He was also saying Froedert hospital were actually the first ones to document this back in the 80s? I don't see anyone talking about that though and it's just Bastian I hear about, so I'm not sure. I'll let you guys know if I decide to go through with it and what they say the cost will be!

I had the trifecta done the same day, including an endoscopy 😂 I was lucky because they put the manometry tube in my nose while I was asleep for the endoscopy. It was pretty uncomfortable to have that tube down my throat because it's kind of big, but that test didn't last super long. I would put it as uncomfortable but not unbearable, but again I was asleep when they put the tube down. 

The pH test tube was similar in size to the scope you mentioned and wasn't bad at all for them to put in, but it was uncomfortable to have it in all day. Talking and eating were the worst, but again not painful, just very uncomfortable. You also have to wear a little computer with a strap that's attached to the tube, so you aren't and to shower or get it wet. I was so excited to get it taken out the next day. I had a bit of a sore throat after all this because of the 3 tubes they shoved down me, but that wore off after a day or two. Try not to worry about them too much! The reason they did the pH test on me is because I have gerd and had pretty bad esophagitis. 

I hope that helps, happy to answer any questions, but try not to worry about it too much, they weren't terrible.

Title    : dentist after Botox?
Selftext :
I'm having my procedure done next Friday (assuming Covid results come in time) and I have a dentist appointment the following Thursday. I was thinking I should cancel that one because I still probably won't have full control of my throat and might be pretty uncomfortable, but I was just wondering how far out from the procedure is probably a reasonable time? I also don't want to be burping uncontrollably in his face while he's looking at my teeth 😂

I had to get an endoscopy, manometry, laryngoscopy, and the 24 hour PH test. I also have pretty bad gerd though, so I think that was mainly what the endoscopy and PH test were for. I think the manometry is pretty standard, as well as a laryngoscopy for r-cpd.

So I was lucky and they put the manometry tube in while I was asleep for my endoscopy. I can't talk to how it feels going in, but the procedure itself wasn't terrible. It was uncomfortable to swallow with a tube down my throat, but it wasn't painful or feel like I was choking or anything. They had me drink sips of water sitting up and laying down and then I also had to drink some weird thick liquid. Them pulling the tube back out wasn't too bad but did feel super weird. It was over in a split second so you don't have time to think about what's happening. 

For the 24 hour one, I was awake when they put that tube in and it wasn't bad. It's super thin like spaghetti and it goes in quickly. It was pretty uncomfortable to talk and eat and I kept feeling like I had to sneeze. I was worried I wouldn't be able to sleep, but that was actually the easiest part of the whole thing 😂 I would definitely ask what that's for if you don't have reflux though! I hope that helps!

Title    : Post Botox update days 0-6
Selftext :
I just wanted to share an update on how my Botox journey has gone so far. I realized recently that I actively started trying to find a doctor to do the Botox a year ago and have been going back and forth with different tests and doctors since then! I finally had my procedure done last Friday with Dr. Jonathan Bock at Froedert hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He seems to follow the way Bastian does it with 3 injections around your sphincter of 25 units each. 

The day of the procedure was so easy and everyone was so kind and helpful. I was in the hospital for probably 4-5 hours or so total including getting there 2 hours early for prep and then recovery afterwards. I was a little nervous but once I got into the operating room, they put me under pretty quickly and next thing I knew it was over! I was a little nauseous on the drive home, super tired, and had a bit of a sore throat. I wasn't really hungry the rest of the day and just had some ice cream and a few bites of soup. I was able to swallow just fine, I just didn't feel like eating. I bought a wedge pillow in anticipation of having reflux from the procedure since I already have pretty bad GERD, so I slept on that the first night just to be safe. I don't think I had any burps the first day unless they were super baby burps. 

The second day I woke up with a super sore throat and had to take Tylenol regularly throughout the day. I was also super nauseous again and threw up 3 times. I think this was the anesthesia still working its way out of my system. I was able to eat just fine, but my throat was sore so I only had Mac and cheese since it was warm, soft, and comforting. I managed to crack out a couple small burps this day, but they were entirely accidental and not really relieving yet. 

The third day, my throat was slightly better but still pretty sore. I was having micro burps when yawning, coughing, or turning my head, but still no control over them. My throat started to feel like there was a bit of a lump in it and I started having a tiny bit of slow swallowing, but really not bad. I just drank some water whenever things didn't want to go down and made sure to chew really well. 

Day four my throat was still sightly sore and I noticed my voice was a bit strained during calls at work. I was still having success burping, but was having to turn my head to push them out and push my lower jaw out a little. I started having some pretty bad reflux this day.

Day five was when things really started getting exciting. My throat wasn't really sore anymore, but my voice was still slightly strained. I decided to get brave and drank a soda to see what would happen. Usually I would be so swollen and in pain for hours after that, but I started burping up a storm and it was the best feeling ever! I found that I could feel when a burp was ready and just push with my stomach a bit and it would come out. After a gurgle, I had pretty good success getting burps out, too. I had some amazing dinosaur sounding burps that were like 5 seconds long and I was so happy! I actually had to cut it off to breathe, otherwise I probably could have kept going! I was also able to get some amazing burps out after lunch and throughout the day. I went on a couple mile walk that night and started having a weird feeling which was maybe regurgitation? It felt like something was coming up my throat as I was walking, so I really had to slow down to granny speeds. This kind of resolved itself when I got back home though.

Day six (today) and the burps are still flowing like crazy! No boating, which is such a weird feeling! I had some meetings and just put myself on mute and kept burping and laughing to myself because it's still so fun. I'm hopeful that things will keep going how they are and this will be the new normal. My only concern is that I'll have problems with reflux again now even though I'm on 80mg of Omeprazole a day. My doctor suspected that might happen though, so getting the Linx procedure might be the next step for me. I just hope that doesn't ruin my burping again somehow. 

Anyways, overall, I'm so happy I was able to get the procedure done and it was 100% worth it so far! If anything changes I'll post another update and I'll try to post one several months out to say if the Botox is still working. I'm so afraid it'll stop, but trying not to worry about that. I'm planning on practicing with soda every day too to really build up the muscle memory. Let me know if you guys have any questions!

For me, I didn't actually think I had bad reflux. I guess I thought how I felt was normal, but apparently not! I would feel like a burning in my throat usually at night when I was laying in bed. That didn't happen all the time, but sometimes I would have to sit up in bed because it felt so bad. I didn't actually go to the doctor for my reflux, but instead trying to find someone to give me Botox. 

He decided he wanted to do an endoscopy because I mentioned I had occasional reflux. Apparently I had stage C esophagitis and my esophagus was narrowed towards the base because of all the scar tissue I had 😱 he put me on 80mg of Omeprazole and I've been on it ever since (almost a year). I had a follow up endoscopy and they said my esophagus has healed since then, but I'm still on the meds until they see what happens with the Botox. I'm not sure if that helps at all, but I'm happy to answer any questions 🙂

Wow, yeah I never connected that to my no burp before but I'm the same way. Whenever someone is like hurry up just finish your drink, I literally can't. I have to wait and can't just gulp things down. I tend to take baby bird sips whenever I drink anything. I got the Botox last Friday and it doesn't seem to have changed anything with that, but I'll definitely take having to take tiny sips as long as I can burp!

I got the procedure done on a Friday and went back to work on a Monday and it was fine, just a little strained when talking on calls. If you're mostly just listening though I think it should be no problem. It also depends on your reaction to the anesthesia because I was still throwing up from it on the second day and still pretty tired. I think it could be okay depending on how active you have to be in the training.

Good luck! Let us know how it goes! I went out yesterday to meet up with friends and get ramen and bubble tea and usually I'm in agony when I do that because the bloating is so bad, but I felt totally fine this time because I was able to burp and it was amazing! I did have one incident at the bubble tea place though because I was laughing, which makes me burp right now and that only made me laugh more and then I started choking and laughing and burping and probably making a huge scene, so just be cautious about laughter 😂

I just had the Botox about a week ago and I definitely burp a lot, but its way better than non stop gurgles and actually provides relief! It just makes me realize how much gas was trapped in me before I had the procedure done. It's also not all the time, I mostly just burp when I eat or drink. I'm still so happy that I'm actually able to though so I really don't care if I burp a ton.

Title    : burps feel... different? 1.5 weeks post Botox
Selftext :
I got Botox on January 28th, almost two weeks ago and the burping has been amazing. I was just curious though if anyone else experienced their burps changing at all as the Botox goes on? I'm not sure if it's because the Botox is more kicked in now, but it almost feels like my throat is even more relaxed now? The burps used to be pretty loud, and sometimes they still are, but sometimes it almost feels like my throat is just more open or something and the air just hisses out or just comes out of my throat silently instead of making burp noises. I can only tell air is coming out because I can taste it. Has this happened to anyone else? Will the burps go back to more regular burps as the Botox wears off?

I recently made an appointment to go in a couple months. I could've found someone locally (Denver) but

1. Bastian is the OG who knows this better than anyone else. Probably most likely to do it successfully, which matters most.

2. Chicago is an awesome city and I miss it.

3. Flights were very cheap (hotel and rental car weren't so much, but we're staying several days more than necessary)

That said, if you do it under general anesthesia (sounds like Bastian can do it as an office visit) the surgery center requires someone to go with you. So that adds an extra layer of logistics. I'm lucky enough that a good friend of mine also loves Chicago and was happy to go with if I bought her ticket.

Good luck tomorrow!  If you've never been put under for general anesthesia, it'll be over before you know it... kinda literally.  When my wisdom teeth were pulled, they told me that when I was done they'd have me bite down on some gauze and that would be totally normal.  Then they told me to bite down on the gauze and they were done.

Did you go with somebody to Chicago, or did you already know someone there?  That was my biggest obstacle to get the logistics of that requirement figured out.

I'm excited for you! I never really thought I hated not burping enough to get surgery for it, but when I found out what it actually entailed and that it's actually a pretty minor thing, I realized I'm just being stubborn per usual. I also got a friend of mine to go with (free trip for her, travel buddy and surgery escort for me) and my appointment is set for early May! And the more I realize how this is affecting me, the happier I am for being on the way to fixing it. Hopefully we're part of the 80%!

I'm honestly way more nervous for the endoscopy. How was that? I don't do so well in medical settings that I'm awake for, and that sounds... Unpleasant.

I know hindsight is 20/20, but honestly I would've gone to Bastian (or someone else who does the Botox injection semi-regularly) a long time ago.  He at least understands the condition better and is way more likely to take you seriously than someone who doesn't.

It may be an issue from an insurance perspective if you go that route. Personally, I was able to get scheduled with no referral or anything and I'll be bypassing insurance (I'm coming in from out of state, and don't think my insurance has anyone in network in Illinois). For what it's worth, I was quoted a little over $3K if I bypass insurance. You'll need someone to go with for the surgery part because you'll be put under, though I think Bastian can do it as an office visit if you're brave enough (there are two other docs that do RCPD stuff in his practice, but they only do the procedure under anesthesia)

I think it's no more than 3 days before surgery, based on something else I saw.  There gets to be a point where you test too far in advance for it to be useful, and they just don't want that to be the case.  On the other hand, if you test negative even more recently, that's a good thing.

I believe Tiffany from BVI said that most people travel back day of, even if by plane.  I chatted with someone here who went back home to eastern Canada without issue.  I'm scheduled to get Botoxed a week before you, and am planning on going back to Colorado that night.

Just to have a common starting point, I googled the definition.

> a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, **or activities**

(emphasis mine)

I remember one of Dr. Bastian's videos mentioning that the bloating can cause shortness of breath, and that limits going out for a run and stuff. And it's no secret that going out for a few beers can exacerbate things and we have to be more careful than others.

With that in mind, I think severe cases and symptoms can be considered a relatively minor disability, maybe even moderately so in the worst cases. But for most, it's a source of discomfort that may not cross that threshold.

I don't know your personal medical trauma and don't want to downplay that, but if it means anything I really don't do well in medical settings and am prone to passing out easily. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how everything went in that regard when I went in last week. Honestly, my biggest freakouts were when the scariest things (to me) were *done* for some reason. Like, after they did the endoscopy or put in the IV needle for surgery. Some things were slightly uncomfortable, but that's really about it.

Good luck! I was there 2 weeks ago. Supposed to be with Dr. Bastian, but he was recovering from covid so they rebooked me with Dr. Richardson instead.

My R-CPD probably isn't as bad as others, and perhaps for that reason my results were a little more subtle... No big burps get. But I've definitely had small burps and big, *productive* gurgles. Today I drank 3 flavored seltzer waters, pretty much consecutively, and I don't feel any negative effects from it (just a stomach that feels like it had 36 Florida ounces of liquid, because of the obvious).

Congrats! I've heard so many similar comments about Dr. Bastian that I was hoping to meet the guy (kind of like a celebrity 🤣 ) but unfortunately he caught covid just before I arrived so I ended up with Dr. Richardson. He was perfectly fine though, and certainly better than trying to find a doctor who is at best skeptical of the condition and trying the procedure.

That was just over 2 weeks ago. The microburps are becoming less, well, micro. I've also felt more control over them in the last week. The PA suggested trying Shaker exercises, and I think that helped - I hadn't really done that before. Basically, the Botox is really starting to take effect and now I need to really practice how I control my body to get it to burp. Multiple cans of seltzer water daily helps, and I don't feel bad at all afterwards, so something is going right!

Edit: also, I shockingly found out that a coworker and even my own boss are no-burpers. I've been recommending they try it out, and at least one is talking about it with his wife.

I haven't thrown up once since Botox (couple weeks ago). Some food goes down easier than others, with the worst things I remember being potatoes and peanuts... But nothing that couldn't be solved with a beverage ready to go.

Honestly, recovery has been really easy overall. The absolute worst moments were few and far between when eating and getting used to Botox. It only lasted a few seconds until I could get some water, and were about as unpleasant as a night of bad boating and gurgling. For me, that was probably minor-moderate compared to others.

You know that [universal pain chart](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/faces-pain-scale-chart-vector-6184085)? Replace pain with discomfort (which is probably a step in the right direction right there) and the absolute worst moments were probably a 4. And that's all they were, *moments*. 99.99% of the time I was between a 0 and 2.

It may be worth a try, actually. I haven't had a chance to look at my EOB as much as I would've liked just yet, but I think my insurance (Anthem) had some slightly negotiated rates with BVI and MCDS. The rest seems to go on my deductible.

Anecdotally, I happen to work in the healthcare claim processing world (public sector, a relatively small program). From what I can tell, the procedures (excluding Botox and room charges, which I'm not sure about) they perform are not really given much scrutiny, same goes with the diagnosis codes.

I still don't have the big, loud burps that my wife has (and just let out literally as I was writing that sentence). I'll have some carbonated beverages, or even my morning coffee, and I still have to try hard to let a burp out... But it does come out still! I've been drinking a few seltzer waters per day as practice.

That said, my R-CPD was probably more minor than most. It's probably understandable that you're not going to get a drastic change out of a not-drastic problem.

Put it this way: if I don't keep burping after it wears off, I'll probably try again (albeit maybe here in Denver instead of another trip to Chicago) and hope I can get a little more Botox next time. The worst part was the endoscopy, but even then I've had more unpleasant experiences getting a covid test done.

There is a wiki somewhere around here, but to cut to the most effective option...

Have you checked out the Botox option?  It's a very minor surgical procedure.  Hardest part is finding a doctor who will do it, because it is pretty unknown.  Basically, you have a muscle in your esophagus that's refusing to relax to burp.  Botox will relax that muscle, and you use that as an opportunity to train your body to burp.  You're only knocked out for a few minutes while they give you that injection, and recovery is generally very easy (I flew back home same day).  Most people are able to keep burping even after the Botox wears out (sometimes a second shot is needed and that usually takes care of it).

The pioneer of that procedure is Dr. Robert Bastian in the Chicago area.  He has a few videos about it on YouTube.  Check them out to start.

I thought the same thing, mainly that surgery seemed so drastic over basically a novelty. Then I realized it explained so many things I thought were normal, and that the surgery is so simple it barely qualifies as surgery. And the cost isn't obscenely bad, either.

For what it's worth, I really don't do well in medical settings. This was easy peasy. Worst part was the endoscopy, which was still easier than a covid test. Surgery was like a short nap.

Title    : Botox a month ago. Easier to burp without carbonation?
Selftext :
Had my procedure at BVI with Dr. Richardson just over a month ago.  Easy recovery, been getting some burps.  But now that things have settled, I've noticed that when I have my morning coffee, I can let out a few burps I didn't even know I needed (yay!)  But when I have some seltzer waters in the afternoon, it's actually harder to burp?  I'm not terribly uncomfortable, but it feels like I'm doing these half-burp-half-gurgles that seem harder to get out than they should be.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Few things to note:

* No emetophobia, but I also don't need to vomit very often

* I've been pushing burps out mostly by pushing my stomach down (or sometimes sucking my chest in) and waiting a moment.  Not sure if that's exactly right, but it seems to help

* None of my burps have been particularly audible unless you were fairly close to me

* Flatulence seems to increase with carbonation still

* I've been trying Shaker exercises, but admittedly I haven't been as diligent about them as I should be.  Usually I do 1-2 sets of 3 daily.

To be honest, that's encouraging for me, being 1.5 months post-Botox and having had only one short noticeably audible burp but a fair number of quiet ones. My wife has always had really loud ones that put me to shame!

The Botox generally lasts 5-6 months, but many people are still able to burp beyond that as your body has successfully relearned how to burp. Often a second shot will do the trick if not.

I'm going on 4 months! Hoping I don't need that second shot, but if I do I can probably squeeze it in locally* before the end of the year. We totally blew through our deductible this year!

\* I went to Chicago to have the first one done, partly because it's been so long since I've been there and I was able to bribe a friend to take me through surgery with a free trip. But BVI told me about someone in the Denver area I can go to if needed, which will be way more practical since I will have a baby at home!

Hope your recovery is as easy as mine was! I haven't really had any big loud burps, but they're definitely there 4 months later. We'll see if that stays a couple months from now, and if not hopefully I can get another shot by end of year since my deductible is maxed tf out this year

Maybe you can talk your parents into having you get it to properly "diagnose" yourself, and gee whiz it also took care of the problem? 😁

Fwiw, my symptoms were always more on the mild-moderate end compared to most. I think I tested myself a 4/7 on most symptoms. Now I generally feel I'm at a 2. Nothing drastic, but an improvement at least. And it's hard to get a drastic improvement on something that didn't have a drastic effect on your life in the first place!

Melissa Wingo (PA at BVI) has been great for my follow-ups to see if things are still going ok for me. I mentioned that I wasn't sure if I'd need a second shot, and if I did I'd probably seek it locally (Colorado). They can't speak to his practice or anything, but they did tell me about a doctor out here who does the same thing out here so I don't have to travel! Really good people there.

Honestly, it took me closer to a month. A big part of it was just figuring out how to burp, like which muscles to tense and which to relax. I'm not sure if this is what people normally do, but I found it works best to kinda push my stomach down and that usually helps.

Also, most burps are pretty silent. That's totally cool, it'll still relieve the pressure. Don't expect Barney Gumble burps any time soon!

If you feel you're suffering, and you can afford to do so, get the Botox treatment. When I first heard about people getting surgery to help them burp I imagined spending tens of thousands of dollars and didn't think it really affected *that* much.

Turns out, the surgery is super simple, not terribly expensive, and not burping does cause other issues. I eventually decided to visit Dr. Bastian, the pioneer of that surgery, in Chicago. Well, it ended up being Dr. Richardson from his practice because he caught COVID. I kinda wanted an excuse to go to Chicago anyway, so it worked out.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, start with the podcast called Reply-all, episode "Gleeks and Gurgles". It kinda covers two topics at once. Either way, great listen. Dr. Bastian also has some great videos explaining it all.

Title    : My burpday was 6 months ago tomorrow. Is there any Botox left in my system?
Selftext :
Still burping, but they have never been particularly big or audible (but still an improvement over pre-Botox days). With the end of the year coming up, I'd like to try to get that second shot ASAP while my out of pocket max is blown out of the water... If needed, of course!

Overall, my symptoms are still there (mild, vs mild-moderate) but I've also been eating... Not the best lately. Became a dad in the last 6 months, and it's been a little crazy! If I have no Botox left in my system and this is probably how things will be for the rest of my life, I'll probably roll with it. But if my minimal burping is hanging by a thread from a few residual traces, maybe I should try to get another?

I'm late to the party, hopefully you've met with him and are happily burping by now.

But if not, or for anyone else who hits this post from a search, I'm getting my second shot with him (first was with Bastian) in a couple days. He seems pretty easy-going. Granted, my experience is a little different in that I'm getting a second shot and that I was hoping for a bigger dose than he usually does (BVI does 75 then 100, Dr. King usually does about 50) but he's very open to what I was asking for in all those things. As a bonus, he spared me from the endoscopy since I already had that done - it's generally a tool to verify there isn't anything more serious happening, which I've already done.

Oh, and he sponsors Colorado Public Radio so that's cool.

Are you interested in the treatment many have gotten? It's a little tricky to find a doctor who does it (depending on where you are) but for being a surgical procedure, it's actually quite simple (tl;dr Botox injection in the esophagus relaxes a muscle that isn't relaxing like it should)

Title    : Second shot, new doc (Dr. J Michael King in Colorado)
Selftext :
In early May, I got my first Botox shot at BVI in Chicago. I was set to meet the legend himself, but he contracted COVID. Thankfully they were able to set me up with Dr. Richardson instead, so it wasn't a waste of a trip (who am I kidding? Chicago is great!). Overall, it was an improvement - I can let out small burps, generally on command as needed. But nothing huge (to use a metric I saw in another thread, nothing I can taste).

Melissa Wingo, the PA at BVI, mentioned that Dr. King with Peak ENT does the same procedure, but they can't vouch for how good a job he does (just because they're unaffiliated). Because my family out of pocket max was way exceeded between my first shot, wife delivering a baby, and that baby being in NICU for several months (home now!) I decided I'd try Dr. King and see if he could squeeze me in before the end of the year.

I ended up getting an appointment at his office in Golden, and was honest that I could go either way on getting a second shot, but would love to try if he had any availability before my insurance resets at the end of the year (isn't it great how our system cares about the calendar year? 🙄 ). He was upfront that he has never done a second shot for someone before, since normally the one works fine. He was also pretty surprised that I had 75 units of Botox and wanted 100 as BVI does... He usually doesn't go above 50. But he was willing to humor me on that and give it a try. Oh, and he let me skip the endoscopy since I already had that done (it's usually meant for verifying that there aren't other serious issues being ignored)

Today, a few weeks later, was B-Day. During prep, he asked if I was sure I wanted to do 100 units, and maybe 75 again would be better. I feel like in my case, I would've preferred 100 from the get-go, and my recovery with 75 was super easy, so I'd like to try 100. He was still willing to roll with it, and took my number for a quick follow-up call tonight or tomorrow to make sure I was doing ok. Procedure went without a hitch, and I was feeling myself again in the recovery room 20 minutes later. Easy peasy.

Oh, and Dr. King did call tonight as promised. I told him that I was doing very well, swallowing soft foods without any problem, and am very glad we did 100 units and maybe it's worth considering 75 to start with other patients (not to tell him how to do his job, but it really didn't feel like a big deal). He seemed to sincerely appreciate the feedback, and we'll talk again in a few weeks in a more official telehealth appointment.

Overall, if any no-burpers are in Colorado, I would definitely suggest giving his practice a call. Oh, and he supports Colorado Public Radio (heard his name called out one afternoon before I came in) so that's a plus!

Edit: 36 hours later, and I had a couple smaller but proper burps that I could actually taste. I've got a good feeling about this!

I was actually the first person to throw out numbers. Since I was his first patient to get a second shot, he asked if I knew how much I had for my first. I told him, and also mentioned what I was hoping to get for round 2. That was before I knew he usually did less. But he was in no way stubborn about it, just kinda making sure I knew what I was potentially in for with a high dosage (trouble swallowing, mainly).

I think that was my favorite thing about him: he was very chill, but also not a pushover. And that quick call to make sure I wasn't having trouble with it afterwards really impressed me.

Title    : 2 weeks follow up after second shot (so far, so good!)
Selftext :
Just a quick post to procrastinate work stuff a little bit.

**Shot #1:** I traveled with a friend to Chicago to get my first Botox injection at BVI in early May 2022.  I was scheduled to have it done with the legend himself, but Dr. Bastian was unfortunately out sick (COVID).  Thankfully, they were able to keep my same schedule (give or take a couple hours) with Dr. Richardson at the practice.  He was fine, no complaints, but maybe not the super-friendly doctor that everyone said Dr. Bastian is.  Still, he did the job and recovery went well.  Flew home (Denver) that day.

**Recovery:** I had the usual "pillow of air" swallowing issues, and had trouble swallowing certain foods like french fries for a few days as the Botox took effect in different ways.  I think I had a hard time figuring out how to burp - not just that my UES didn't allow it, but I just wasn't sure which muscles I should contract and which should be relaxed.  Eventually I'd get some small burps by pushing my stomach down.  I could tell they weren't what they fully could be, (nothing "tasteable", still hard to burp if I had too much carbonation) but it was still an improvement.

**In between:** Wife had a baby hella early.  Baby stayed in NICU for a long time.  Both are doing great now, but our out of pocket max was blown way the hell out of the water.  So any doctor visits or whatever we had were covered 100% by insurance.

**Shot #2:** I recently posted about this already, but a quick recap: I went through Dr. King at Peak ENT in Golden+Broomfield, Colorado (Denver suburbs), since he was pretty local to me.  BVI told me about that practice when I mentioned I was considering a second shot, but they couldn't vouch for their work since they were unaffiliated (understandable).  Not surprisingly, Dr. King doesn't see as many R-CPD patients as BVI, and he had never done a second shot before.  But he was open to trying it out.  He asked about my experience the first time (recovery, difficulty swallowing, etc) and asked if I happened to know how much Botox I got last time.  I told him 75 units, but BVI typically does 100 for the second shot.  He was a little shocked, since he generally does 50 at most.  Still, he had an opening before the end of the year (fully covered by insurance!) and was willing to try 100.  Gave me a quick "are you sure you don't want to try 75 again?  That sounds like a lot" check pre-op, but that was about it.  IMO, it was a perfect balance of listening to the patient, but not being a pushover either.

**Recovery:** About the same as before, minus the flight home.  Dr. King gave me a call that night to make sure I was doing ok after 100 units, which I really appreciated (and I was happy to tell him I felt great).  I had forgotten about the "pillow of air" swallowing issues until it came back.  I mostly remembered having a hard time swallowing dryer foods, but oh well.  Totally manageable.  And I had some genuine tasteable burps a day or two later!

**Now:** Two weeks later, and the burps continue!  Kind of a mix between the small internal ones I've had, and the bigger ones.  Honestly, I've had more burps in the span of a couple days than I (somehow accidentally) had in my entire life prior!  Feels good.  I'm still working on being able to burp on command as needed, but it's totally improving.  I feel like the bloating and flatulence (and definitely the gurgles) have gone down even more.  I was on the fence about if I wanted to try and get a friend to take me across town for surgery and go through the hassle of it all, but now I am sooo glad I did.  Especially since it was fully covered by insurance (I believe even the Botox!  Haven't gotten a bill yet).  And I'm oddly excited for my follow-up call with Dr. King next week where I can tell him all of this!

It's a very safe, simple procedure. The hard part is finding a doctor who believes/understands/treats it. Maybe if you can tell us your specific concern we can tell you more?

Bastian Voice Institute in the Chicago area almost certainly does a solid majority of these procedures, and Dr. Bastian has lots of videos about it (one of which explains possible side effects). I recently had it done a second time in the Denver area and was very happy with the doctor I had - see my recent post.

They did, but keep in mind this was my second shot. I was kinda sorta burping in the first place, just not very well. I think I had proper burps on day 2? Definitely no later than day 3.

One thing with Dr. King, he has done 50 units in the past. That's not nothing, but it is on the lower end of what's typical for this. He gave me 100, but only because I had 75 once before and tolerated it very well. I knew BVI does 75, then 100 if needed. He was a bit hesitant, but willing to try. He also seemed open to trying more on others, knowing I took it well (he called me night of to check in). I have my other follow up appointment Thursday and will tell him all went well.

Bottom line, tell him you bumped into that guy who got 100 units on a second shot online, and the two of you can decide what's best. There will be swallowing side effects, but it's manageable and temporary.

Always love seeing stories like this. Isn't it amazing how it's such a simple procedure for an obscure condition, and it makes such a difference?

I popped into this sub occasionally. I knew I couldn't burp, but it didn't bother me much (or so I thought). Surgery just seemed so drastic and expensive. Plus I don't like medical settings. Then I listened to a podcast that included an interview with Dr. Bastian, the doctor in Chicago. I learned just how simple the procedure is... And with that, how reasonably-priced it is too. Long story short, I got it done (ended up getting a second shot later on, but that's not really the norm) and am so glad I did!

What kind of doctor are you seeing? Many are unaware of R-CPD and skeptical when you bring it up. Generally, you'll want to see an ENT, specifically an otolaryngologist (works with the throat). They'd be the ones doing the procedure anyway, not a PCP.

That said, many are still a little skeptical sometimes. But search this subreddit and the wiki, many major places have at least one doctor nearby who will do it. If not, Chicago is a great place to visit if you want to see the OG, Dr. Bastian 🙂

I've had 2 shots. The first (75 units from BVI) helped me burp, but they were at best little micro burps. My second shot was 100 units done by another doctor who usually does about 50. He was hesitant to give me double what he normally does, but I told him I did fine with recovery when I had 75 and would like to try just a little more (and if I had more trouble than expected, it would be my own damn fault).

Ok, so with that said... The side effects are a thing, absolutely. But they aren't a debilitating thing at all. You'll feel different, but as Dr. Bastian said in the video I saw in his office, you can safely swallow no matter how you feel - the food will go to a safe place. Just chase your food with a little extra water if you feel the need. It's not terrible by any stretch, and it will pass. You'll just feel a little different is all, and really only when eating!

Hello! My symptoms probably weren't as severe as others, but I decided to get the treatment anyway. I figured it was bound to get worse with time, and if it inevitably gets so bad that I need it, I may as well have done it sooner. Besides, I was overdue to visit Chicago and wanted an excuse (but there are doctors in other places, see the subreddit's wiki).

If it's a thing, and you have the means, absolutely do it.

There's also an episode of the Reply-All podcast called Gleeks and Gurgles. It starts with a much different topic, but lands on R-CPD. Listening to that made me realize how simple the procedure really is (the idea of getting surgery seemed absurd and expensive prior to that) and changed my mind.

Awesome!  Yeah, my insurance (Anthem BCBS) has a fairly high deductible, but between my first treatment earlier in the year, wife delivering a baby, and that baby being in NICU for quite a long time, my second one with Dr. King was fully covered as our family out-of-pocket was blown out of the wayer.  BVI was a few grand before that point.  If it's affecting you, it's well worth it (especially since it *should* last a lifetime).

They probably told you, but just an FYI: you'll need someone to go with you for the procedure to drive you home.  Ideally they'll be with you after as well.  Recovery is pretty easy, but you really shouldn't be driving after being knocked out (even if you feel good)

I only had a chance to bring it up at the end when we were wrapping things up, so it wasn't too in-depth of a chat, but I gave him the elevator pitch that it's about a tight cricopharynx (which he predicted), Botox is a common cure (he knew about that for some swallowing stuff, which is what my daughter was in for), and that it can cause bloating and stuff. Oh, and I was actually able to confidently pronounce "retrograde cricopharangeal dysfunction" and the name alone was enough of an explanation for him.

I did it almost a year ago, so I can't remember exactly, but I believe it was actually done through the nose and slightly minty? The fact that I can't remember exactly shows how easy that part really was.

One thing I remember is how the numbing stuff was so easy, I was afraid I didn't get enough for it to do its job. But when they put the camera in, no big deal!

I had to take my infant daughter to an otolaryngologist a month or so ago, and he had to do the same thing to her. Did she cry? Sure. But she's a baby, pretty much any new sensation does that. The fact that she wasn't screaming her head off, nor did it last long after he was done, should be a good sign!

Also, at least with some insurances, it may be covered. My plan has a fairly high deductible, but last year we hit our OOP max. I got a second shot at the very end of last year after thinking the first could've had a little more oomph, and it didn't cost me a dime (even the Botox was covered).

That reminds me, I paid Midwest Center for Day Surgery for at least the Botox at check-in when I had it done about a year back. A month or so ago, I got a few hundred dollars mysteriously credited to my credit card. Maybe insurance covered more than they expected?

"Ok, when you wake up we'll have you bite down on some gauze. Don't worry, that's perfectly normal. Now bite down on this gauze; we're done" (wisdom teeth removal)

"What do you think will be the last thing you remember before I knock you out?" "Probably you asking me that ques-" (Botox #1)

"Take 3 deep breaths with this mask. It won't put you to sleep yet" (Botox #2, there was probably something after but I don't remember it)

Bonus: my brother was about to be put under for surgery. He was afraid, so dad went with. Anesthesiologist told my dad he could leave while my brother was still awake. "No dad don't-"

Bottom line: general anesthesia is super easy! I'll take that over the camera up the nose any day of the week.

Hello! I also went through Dr. Richardson at BVI for my first shot. It was supposed to be the legend himself, but he had COVID that week. Dr. Richardson is just fine though, very friendly, and the R-CPD treatment is so routine and so easy compared to everything else they do. I don't have emetophobia, but I didn't do well in medical settings, especially when things don't go as expected. I told Dr. Richardson as much, and he completely understood. Be up front about your own issues, and I'm sure he'll help you through it. You aren't the only no-burper with emetophobia or similar.

The scope is the most unpleasant part of the whole thing. The covid test comparison is pretty darn accurate. Numbing agent wasn't bad at all in my experience. They just had you sniff some misty (mint-scented) thing. I didn't think it was going to do anything, because I didn't feel not feeling anything (if that makes sense). But when they got did the camera, it wasn't bad at all. Again, unpleasant, but not painful or anything.

He had me match a note singing on a keyboard, eat a few cheez-its, drink some kind of Kool aid thing... Actually good at distracting from the camera to be honest. I don't remember having pop rocks though. I'll admit there was one point at the end where I could feel the camera kinda in my throat, kinda like a couple popcorn kernel shells (you know what I'm talking about)... but I swear to you: that worst part only lasts a few seconds and when you get through that, you're pretty much done. You will have gone through a couple minutes of painless unpleasantness, and it's all pretty easy from there and you'll be on the road to a lifetime of burpability.

Well, he tried to show me what he saw on the video after and I didn't do so well with that. But he was happy to cut that short.

Day of procedure, I got a little squeamish when they had to give me the IV (one of my first pre-op steps) even after they were done. The nurses at MCDS are so so so sweet and understanding. Wet washcloth for my forehead, warm blankets for me... Felt pretty good. Got wheeled to the operating room, general anesthesia meant I got a nice nap, and before I knew it I was groggy and eating applesauce in the recovery room.

Not even 2 months later, my daughter was born super early. Lots of time spent in the NICU meant I got desensitized to medical stuff - go figure.

I'm not going to bullshit you and tell you that the whole thing is absolutely nothing. But it IS totally manageable, everyone will work with you very well if you communicate, and it will be so worth it in the end. Besides, Chicago is a great city to visit!

Someone else posted the information for the doctor, but one other common piece of advice on this sub (and something that I used to do for instant relief even before I found this sub) was to make myself nearly vomit by sticking two fingers down my throat. The gagging and nearly upchucking of my lunch did result in some terribly nasty noises (and nearly did make me actually vomit once or twice), but it would release a ton of gas that instantly relieved me of that suffering you speak of.

The more I’ve done that method, the more I can sort of cough-burp in public where I release the gas and make a half cough/half yacking noise. It still sounds pretty rough and makes me teary-eyed, so I usually bury my face in my arm and turn away and it works inconspicuously enough to where no ones really commented on it.

I think for situations like the baseball game, you could go to the bathroom, try the forced gag reflex, and get the gas out easily (you won’t be the first one making hurling sounds in the toilet at a game). For situations like work, I’ve luckily come to a point where I can walk around or go to the bathroom and cough-burp stealthily enough to not take much time or garner attention. Hopefully you’ll get to that point sometime soon, but for now I strongly recommend the forced-gag method - it really worked for me!

Title    : I just burped (small but legit, not croaks) about 3-4 times in a row. Might have caught on to something here.
Selftext :
A few disclaimers - I just drank a LaCroix (carbonated water) and so I am feeling extra croaky/gurgly right now. I also just discovered this and have not tested it past just now. But I did just get immediate relief and am excited to share it with someone else it could potentially help. 

So right now I'm sitting at my desk at home, and like I just mentioned above I'm feeling extra gurgly due to having just drank a very carbonated drink. Randomly, I started resting my forehead on my desk and browsed reddit on my phone with my forearms/elbows on my knees/thighs, with my phone under the desk. So my head and neck are parallel with the ground and the weight of my head was mostly resting on the desk w/ my forehead. 

I started getting croaks again but this time, with a little bit of a push from my diaphragm and a slight opening of my throat (as if I were about to imitate an opera singer), I was able to actually burp quite effortlessly. Not huge belches, but they were actual small burps which still felt a lot better than just the gurgles. At first, I thought okay that's just one of those one-off one's, but then I actually was able to replicate it quite effortlessly another 2 or 3 times straight. 

I have no idea why this helped, BUT my complete armchair hypothesis at the moment might be that my esophagus was more relaxed this way (not sure if was the angle of my neck, or the fact that maybe the weight of my head was resting on the desk with no tension?). Either way, I took another big gulp of LaCroix and tried again. At first I had the same old croaks occurring even with my forehead on my desk, then after a few of them and some experimentation with my throat opening + diaphragm pushing, I was able to again produce a legitimate burp, not a croak. 

I'm going to keep trying this over the next few days and see if it works consistently. Perhaps if it even will affect my normal burps without the forehead resting method (I've read some people on here saying they've been able to "train" themselves to burp and once they got it, they got it - however until now that hasn't really worked for me). But yeah, this is something novel that I wanted to share with y'all (and hopefully some of you will find that it works too!).

Title    : Self-taught burping progress
Selftext :
Wanted to share some progress and methodology on how I've been starting to train myself how to burp! 

One method that works some of the time is craning my neck down - this doesn't work 100% of the time but did start to get some small burps out which I think have contributed to me being able to burp "normally" and upright more consistently as I start to learn what it's supposed to feel like. Essentially I came across this by accident when I was sitting at my desk - I started looking down at my phone on my lap with only my neck craned down and head parallel to my thighs. All of a sudden I felt a gurgle come up and so I sort of tried to "push" it out with my throat muscles and flexing of stomach, and to my surprise it came out as a quick and sudden belch! This method has worked on separate occasions but is not perfect - it also looks a little funny and I've only done it while sitting down. It did, however, get me used to how the gas feels while escaping and I think primed me for the next step. 

What I'm doing now is drinking some fizzy water or soda (I know, it can be uncomfortable so only try this when you have free time). When you feel bubbles or gurgles coming up, try to actually *constrict* your throat and hold the air in your lungs in. Like flex your neck muscles a bit and actually create sort of a tight vacuum in your throat and hold it in. It seems counter-intuitive because most of us no-burpers want to force it *out* and expel it, but the trick is to actually do the opposite. Then when you feel bubbles or gurgles coming up, hold it constricted as long as you can - the vacuum in your throat then sort of builds up all the bubbles and if you open your throat back up at the right time, it should expel much easier than actually trying to force it out. 

A few caveats here - as I'm sitting here typing this out, some of the "vacuum bubbles" still sound like horrific croaks or the exorcism of some terrible carbonated ghost leaving your body. So achieving a standard "burp" may not happen all the time. But man, it actually feels like I'm expelling the bubbles and trapped gas much more efficiently and effectively, and so even if it sounds weird, at least I FEEL much better and relieved in a much QUICKER time than letting the gurgles control me. And I'm getting a solid belch every 10 or so tries. 

I hope this helps some of you! I can finally start to fully enjoy carbonated drinks again and I'm sure many of you are wanting to do the same. Start out with that craning neck method to see if it helps you gain the feeling of gas being expelled easily, or go right for the vacuum method and see if that feeling helps there.

I recently posted about a method which I found to help achieve actual burps in a normal, upright position. I have no idea if it will help you or any others as it is purely anecdotal for me...but essentially when I have an influx of small gurgles or croaks (especially after drinking carbonated water), I've found that the proper way to get them to leave is to actually constrict your throat and create a sort of "vacuum" for the bubbles to congregate quickly. Then after a quick throat constriction and feeling of gas accumulating, quickly open your throat back up while giving a slight push of the diaphragm. 

So often, we non-burpers try to push the air out of our throats with little to no success - when for me, at least, the trick is to actually do the opposite and *constrict* your throat muscles (flex your neck) when you feel gas coming up. That way it almost seems to build up all in one go and makes the expulsion a more natural process. Hope this helps for you!

Hm the best way to describe it would be like....if you were acting like an invisible hand were choking you (a la Darth Vader in Star Wars), you would sort of constrict your neck muscles so that they get all tight right? That would be the best way to describe what I'm talking about. It's almost like you "squeeze" the air out of your throat", and if you put your hands to your neck you could actually feel the muscles all tightened up around your skin. That's the best way to try and describe it. Somehow by creating this sort of "air vacuum" in your throat the bubbles actually expel up and out much faster than if you try to "open up" your throat and "push" the bubbles out. It sounds contradictory but for me it works!

Title    : Any singers who have gotten the Botox treatment done? What has your experience been like?
Selftext :
As a lifelong singer (luckily only for fun, not professionally - although I do love singing more than anything) I’m nervous to get the Botox treatment done for fear of ruining my voice. But on the other hand I just went through such an awful night of no-burping in front of some friends that I am convinced that I need to get this procedure done. Any post-operation feedback from other singers would be greatly appreciated! Mostly curious about its effects on tone and range. Thanks!

Title    : Hello everyone! /Any update on a Doctor in Canada?
Selftext :
 Let me just say that I feel at home here lol. I've been lurking on this group for a couple of years now and reading everyone's experiences. It's made me feel not so alone on this and I'm happy other people understand what I'm going through. I was born with the condition but only in the last year or so has it started to make me feel like garbage! After every meal I eat, and anything I drink, bloated and chest pain, makes it hard to breath. It finally became to much and I talked to my family Dr in BC. He surprisingly was very good when I told him and did not take it lightly. It's been months in the process of going for tests, barium swallow, motility test, x-rays, gastronomy, I just completed the last one before the holidays. He said if it didn't show anything to him that he would refer me to one of the Dr's that practiced the botox treatmen. I was thinking that that may be Dr. Amanda Hu in Vancouver, but I just discovered the multiple threads on here about her not practicing this treatment any longer. Does anyone know if Dr Jennifer Anderson in Toronto is still practicing this procedure?  Or have they found any other Dr's to perform it? Would appreciate any info anyone has. Finally felt like I was about to make some headway with this and I hope it may not be down the drain. I don't have the money to be able to pay for treatment out of pocket. Any info is much appreciated!  Thanks 😊

Title    : Disappointed in my Doctor
Selftext :
Well it has been just over 8 months now since I initially brought up my no burp problem with my doctor. When I first presented my problem to him I was actually kind of shocked with how understanding he was with me. I explained to him that it has been a problem I have had since birth.  Although he was a bit surprised as he had never heard of this problem before, he assured me that we would get to the bottom of it but that it was going to require a series of tests, which I obviously agreed to.

The first test was a Barium swallow. That was nasty and tasted like drinking the inside of a dollar store haha. My Dr. Called me within a week to follow up.The results from that were not completely clear but did show that there was some type of issue present. 

The next test he ordered for me was a motility test which required me to swallow these radioactive beads and then go to the hospital every day for 5 days to get an x-ray of my digestive system. Although this was paintless and mostly just an inconvenience to leave work for an hour each day to get my x-ray, I was more than happy to do it because it meant getting my problem fixed. My doctor called me once again with the results about a week later. He told me that that test did not show anything that was a concern. He then said there was one more test he wanted me to have and then if there were still no answers that he would then refer me to either Dr. Amanda Hu in Vancouver, or to Dr. Jennifer Anderson in Toronto (the 2 doctors in Canada that are currently known for offering the botox treatment).

The next step for me was to be referred to a GI specialist that was about an hour away from where I live. She then had a consultation appointment with me via video chat and performed a gastroscopy of my throat the following week. This procedure was also a breeze but I was not allowed to drive for 24 hours after due to being sedated, and my throat was a bit sore. When I woke up after the procedure she came and gave me the results right away. She told me that everything appeared to be in working order and that I had no signs of "achalasia". She advised me that I would feel a lot better if I "chew and swallow my food slower". Although I was a bit irritated at her for telling me to eat slower, (because I already eat slow and chew my food thoroughly, I get symptoms even from having a sip of water) I was also excited because I thought that this would mean I would finally get referred to see one of the Dr's practicing the botox treatment in Canada. All I had to do now was wait for my Dr. to get in touch with me when he received my results.

That test was at the beginning of December so I figured my doctor would probably still call me within a week or so. Well I waited, and waited. Then we were into the holidays with Xmas and New Years so I figured that maybe he was enjoying some much needed time off and that I would hear from him after the new year. No problem (although I was antsy to get my referral and get the next waiting period in motion. I waited one more week after new years and when I still didn't get a call from him, I decided to phone and book an appointment for the following Monday (today).

Upon talking with my Dr today, he told me exactly what the GI specialist tried to tell me, eat slower. I explained to him that I already was eating as slow as I can be and my symptoms are worsening to the point where I've been in so much pain and discomfort that I have induced vomiting a few times for relief. After telling him that, he told me that it was now beyond his knowledge but that the GI specialist I saw had told him that if we wanted to further pursue testing that she could refer me to see some other specialists in Calgary, which is a bigger city about 4 hours away from me. I then tried to explain RCP-D to him again and the treatment, and the 2 Dr's in Canada that offered the treatment. I even tried to offer to email him Dr Bastian's documents on the condition, to which he cut me off and said, "That's not what you have, your issues are stemming from something lower in your stomach and not the cricopharyngeal muscle! I am going to send a letter to the GI specialist and ask her to refer you to Calgary!" That was the end of that conversation. Guess I'm stuck waiting yet again....

I'm pretty disappointed in my Dr. as he was super through the entire process until today. I am trying not to argue with him over this as in my area there is a crazy Dr. shortage and it took me 5 years of being on waiting lists before my Dr. took me on as a patient. I don't want to piss him off and be without a Dr. again, and it isn't like I can just ask for a new Dr. due to the shortage. It's extremely frustrating after being so close to treatment.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to go about talking to your Dr. About this condition and how to get referred to where you need to be. I don't want to be one of those asshole patients that diagnoses themselves with something they found online. However, I am 99.9% sure I have RCP-D and this is something I have been looking into and reading everything the internet has to offer for years now. 

I was thinking of printing off all of the articles on the condition and taking them with me when I get referred to the specialist in Calgary and discussing it with them. Maybe they can provide me with a referral to 1 of the 2 Dr's in Canada if my current Dr. won't. 

Anyways I am sorry for the novel but I appreciate your time for reading my story and for any ideas you have to further my progress to getting a referral to the right Dr.

>I have read so many times stories like yours that I do not know to whom should I be angry to : to the almost 100% of doctors that are a waste of time , money , physical and mental health ? or to the people like you that because they have not done their homework before trying to solve their R-CPD issue , or because they are simply naive , are repeating the same frustrating story dr Bastian has called medical jadedness in his first paper.

I appreciate you taking the time to share the information. I have also seen numerous posts that have been similar to mine and have seen your write up in the comments. I have looked over it all numerous times. I know it must be a little irritating seeing them pop up as we figure out our situations so thanks for your patience with us.


>hence visiting a doctor who does not already know about R-CPD is almost always a waste of time , hence take a look at this list of doctors who already know about R-CPD .

Believe me if I could have right off the bat went to a doctor that already knew about the condition I would have! Unfortunately the way the healthcare system in Canada works is not as simple as just calling up a Doctor and telling them you want to receive treatment from them. As the only 2 doctors familiar with R-CPD in Canada are both highly sought after specialists, you first need to get a referral from your general practitioner before they will consider seeing you.


>Why did you accept to do all these tests you have done? None of them diagnoses R-CPD .

To piggyback off of what I just said about how to get a referral in Canada, even though from my own research I knew those tests would not provide me with a diagnosis, most Doctors will not just refer you to a specialist because you diagnose yourself with a condition you found on the internet. Before they finally get to that point they run a series of tests to rule out the possibility of the problem being something else. 
Frustrating as all hell but sometimes you have to jump through some hoops to get going where you need to go and get the ball rolling.

UPDATE: So today I made an online appointment with a Dr from Kelowna on Well Health. Signed up and my appointment was about an hour later. When the Dr signed on he asked how he could help me today, to which I asked if he wanted the short or long story? He said the short story so I explained my condition to him, that I felt my Dr was not listening to my concerns, and told him that I wanted a referral to Dr Hu. He looked her up and told me no problem! I will send a referral through for you and her office will be in touch to book an appointment. I can't believe how easy that was after my Dr putting me through test after test and not listening to me. For anyone having a hard time getting a referral I would highly recommend this route! 
Thanks again @sinkingkitten for telling me about this! Biggest breakthrough I've had in months!

I've had the condition since I was born. Although growing up there were times that I would occasionally have symptoms it was never anything I was concerned about. About 3 years ago I started to notice symptoms more frequently and my tolerance started to go down with it as well. 2 years ago I started experiencing symptoms every day.

I get it from time to time, not constant but probably a few times a month on my left side as well. I've been checked out as well and nothing shows signs of an unhealthy heart. I assume it's from not being able to burp since it usually comes on when I'm really bloated

You're not alone! It is a common symptom. One I've dealt with since childhood. I'm probably the fartiest person I know 😂 it sucks big time in social situations having to hold it in and be in even more pain and get more bloated from already not being able to burp.

I finally got my referral to Dr Amanda Hu in Vancouver about 3 weeks ago. Still have not heard from her office on scheduling an appointment with her, but I have spoke with a few others on here who have either been treated by her, or have appointments booked with her. I am really hoping that it works out with her! I'll keep you updated on my progress with her. I would recommend getting your referral now though because by the sounds of things she may send you for additional tests which can take some time to get booked with COVID.
Cheers!

Title    : Update: Treatment in Canada
Selftext :
I have seen quite a few posts the last little bit from fellow Canadians that seem to have some confusion on getting treatment in Canada, thinking they will need to travel out of the country to see Dr Bastian. That's not really feasible right now with the pandemic unfortunately right now. It's also thousands of dollars out of pocket to receive treatment in the US. 

There's also been a number of posts that are a bit confusing on whether or not Dr Amanda Hu in Vancouver is still offering the procedure. I myself was confused and uncertain with the status of this because of those posts. Still I finally managed to get a referral to her after about 10 Months of trying. There were a few others on this group that I had reached out to that also had appointments booked with her, or received treatment in the past. They gave me a bit of insight on what to expect for timelines. 

I had my phone consultation appointment today. I thought I would share my experience so far to put some hope back into receiving treatment in  domestically in Canada. My appointment wasn't actually with Dr Hu but with her associate Dr Yung. He was super great! I told him my story and the tests I had been through the last few months (Barium Swallow, Motility Test, Gastroscopy) and all of my symptoms. He asked me a few questions about some of my symptoms. After that he told me that he was going to go talk to Dr Hu for a few minutes about everything and call me back, but he thought they would most likely book an appointment to bring me in and see me in person. He called back about 5 minutes later and said that they came up with a plan for me! They want me to go for 1 more test which is the esophageal manometry, which I was already expecting they would want based on other people's experiences. He said that he was going to put the request in right away for it but that it usually takes a few months to book this one and that it is backed up from COVID. He said they want to see me at the clinic in person as well but because I live so far away that they wanted to give the pandemic time to ease a bit so it doesn't mess up travel plans if they end up getting shut down again. So he booked me in for 6 months from today on August 6th. He also said that should be enough time to go for the test and get the results back. He also discussed briefly with me about the botox procedure if everything checks out.

I know its not over yet, and although I don't have an official date or promise of treatment at this point, and I'm back to waiting for a few more months, this is the most progress I have made so far in terms off receiving treatment! Despite other posts on here saying that Dr Hu did not offer the procedure anymore, I was told by her secretary that she does treat RCP-D and Dr Yung also mentioned the treatment. It feels like I am finally in the right hands and on the road to treatment.

Again, I just wanted to share my experience so far to provide some hope for other Canadian no burpers who are seeking out treatment. I have also had a number of people wanting me to update them on my progress and I can't totally remember who you all are, so hopefully this gets to everyone that was wanting to know.
Hope this helps some of you.
Thanks for reading!

Hmm interesting,. I'm glad he was still able to get treatment from Dr Bastian and make the trip. I did need a referral to see Dr Hu and that was pretty difficult to get. One of my other posts talks about the run around I went through with my family Dr. I ended up having to book an online appointment at a virtual clinic with a new Dr I had never met before. He sent my referral through after 5 minutes of talking to me. I don't doubt your friend had trouble getting a Dr to see him or take him seriously, we seem to get the run around. If you haven't tried to start the process yet I would definitely try to first before going to the US. Feel free to message me if you have any questions 😊

It is my understanding from others that I have talked to that the cost of the surgery is covered by our medical. The only thing you do have to pay out of pocket for is the actual units of botox that are injected which is about $450. If you have extended medical through work this may or may not cover it.

Title    : I had my in-person consult with Dr. Amanda Hu yesterday.
Selftext :
For those in Canada that have been following my treatment journey so far, yesterday was the big day that I finally got to meet with Dr. Hu in person after talking with one of her residents on the phone back in February and then him booking me for this appointment. I was also supposed to have a manometry test done before this appointment which they told me may not happen because the wait time was so lengthy. I actually got the call for it last week that I had been booked in for November. Because Dr Hu is in Vancouver and I'm on the other side of BC I had to catch a flight in to see her. She was running about 45 minutes behind schedule but I didn't mind as I was just greatful to be able to meet with her. She was very apologetic for the delay and thanked me several times for my patience. She reviewed all of my previous tests and then asked me more questions. Then she stuck the camera up my nose and down my throat to check everything out (honestly not that bad, just a bit uncomfortable). She was extremely compassionate and understanding about all of my symptoms and what I was going through. It felt strange to finally be heard  and understood by a Dr. She told me that she believes I would be a good candidate for the botox procedure,  however she does require me to have the manometry test first just to confirm the last part of how she diagnoses and images or else the botox can do more harm. She didn't belive it would be an issue though and actually processed all of the paperwork for the botox procedure for me while I was there to save some time since I was from out of town. I'm back to waiting for a few more months and will have to make probably 2 more trips back, however I feel like I am finally on the right road to getting treatment after getting the run around from my family Dr. Dr. Hu couldn't have been more compassionate and caring!

Was this a motility test, or a manometry?  I had a motility test done over a year ago and it wasn't bad. No tubes down the throat. They just make you swallow radioactive beads and then make you go for x rays to see them pass through your system for a few days in a row. I am going for a manometry next week however and I believe that one involves a camera up the nose and down the throat.  I'm a bit nervous for it.

Title    : Problems with lower esophageal sphincter? Will it affect my chance of getting botox?
Selftext :
I just had my esophageal manometry that Dr Hu had wanted me to get. It was pretty unpleasant but I made it through. The my lower esophageal sphincter isn't working properly and looks like it is most likely due to years of being exposed to acid reflux. I haven't ever had a problem with acid reflux that I've known so that was a bit surprising. My question is, has anyone else ever experienced this and has it affected or hindered them from getting the green light to get the botox procedure?  It kind of seems like a different issue all together to me as it is down lower. The Dr even said that it didn't have much to do with the inability to burp since it was the upper sphincter in question. She was pretty compassionate towards our cause. She even told me that she researched RCPD and there just isn't a ton of info on it yet but she was going to talk to Dr Hu about how a manometry doesn't fully diagnose the issue because it only looks at the motility function going down and not up. She then told me she wanted to see about introducing a part into the test where the patient drinks a carbonated beverage while they study the sphincter to see how it reacts because she believed that this would diagnose it. Then she ran out of the room and came back with a ginger ale and asked if I would be willing to try it out at the end of the normal test. I said yes! However my test took a bit longer than normal because I was pretty uncomfortable and kept gaging and she decided to skip it unfortunately.  Guess we won't know for now. Anyways... anyone know what my chances of still getting botox are?

I also had this come back as a result that my LES was not working after I had the manometry done last month. I didn't have the official processed results from the test yet (the Dr performing the procedure had just told me while I was there) about a week or 2 later my specialist who is the one treating me for RCP-D called to book me in for botox not realizing I had already gone for the manometry. When I had asked her if my low functioning LES would impact my chances of being a candidate for botox she informed me that it wouldn't as RCP-D is an issue with the UES and has nothing to do with the LES. My results from the test were still not processed at that point but she said she would review them and contact me if there was anything of concern. I have not heard anything from her and that was a couple of weeks ago now so I assume all is good. The Dr that was performing the test on me and informed me of the problem said that it usually comes from years of acid reflux (which I never had) because of stomach acid splashing on it and wearing it out. It can cause problems like Gerd and you may need to go for further testing if you are in pain.

I was also very nervous that my Dr was going to say no to giving me the botox treatment.  I felt like I had just had all my work undone from last 2 years of tests when I was finally getting the last one I needed before they would give me the botox. It was a pleasant surprise when she had no issues with it and didn't seem to bat an eye at it at all. Just stay positive and hopefully it will also be the same for you. I am sorry to hear you have some other compounded problems to go along with it. That's terrible. After doing a bit of research into what can cause damage to a LES without reflux I believe mine was caused by some harsh antibiotics I was put on as a teen to treat my acne. I don't believe I'm going to look into having it treated any further at this point. It isn't bothering me right now. The issue at hand is my R-CPD.  I think once I get that handled I will feel like an entirely new person. Also on a side note, the Dr that did my manometry said the next test for the low functioning LES would be an acid study which involves another tube up the nose and down the throat, into the stomach, this time though they leave it in for 24 hours and send you home with it so it can monitor the acid in your stomach. Then you go back the next day to take it out. I'm still gaging at the though of the last test and I don't think I can handle that one yet lol. One other question,  I noticed from one of your other posts it looks like you're in Canada, I am as well... are you getting treated by Dr Anderson or Dr Hu?

I can usually mind over matter things but not this one. I swear I can still feel the thing in the back of my throat moving around. I'm being treated by Dr Hu. I'm not sure how Dr Anderson is but so far Dr Hu has been nothing but amazing! And if Dr Anderson isn't willing to give you the botox because of this, it may be worth getting a second opinion from Dr Hu. Especially if you have had all of the tests done already. She makes it pretty easy with phone consults so you don't have to travel a bunch. I live about 12 hours away from her so it's been great!

So update: Dr Hu just called me and said she finally received the results from my motility test. There was another abnormality found on the test and I only have 30% of my swallowing function. Because of this if she was to do the botox procedure it would bring my swallowing function down to 0% and I wouldn't be able to swallow at all. My procedure is now canceled and she referred my to another GI Dr for further testing as she believes I don't have RCP-D anymore. I'm a bit devastated

I also don't ever hiccup or get heart burn or have the feeling of air being trapped in my esophagus except for when I get the gurgles. I however was on track to receive the botox next week until my results came back from my motility test that I had done last month. They actually reveled that my LES is not working properly and is very low functioning,  on top of this I also only have about 30% of my normal swallowing function. The Dr's were surprised that I don't get heart burn and don't have trouble swallowing food.  This did however mean that my botox got canceled because if they proceeded it would mean that it would leave me with 0% swallowing function and I wouldn't be able to eat of drink. So now I'm back to more tests. I did start doing the shaker exercise though and have managed to get out some micro burps so I'm going to keep practicing with that

I am in the process of trying this method. I was actually scheduled in for botox this weekend however it got canceled because a motility test found I had severe issues lacking the ability to swallow and the botox would have completely paralyzed my ability to swallow and eat and drink. Becoming desperate I decided to do the shaker exercise,  then I saw this method and started to combine the 2 together... I have been having a few micro burps a day. They have been consistently getting longer, and more frequent and easier to get out. It definitely isn't an easy or quick solution but I am hopeful and I am going to be persistent with it because it may be my only avenue for a cure!

Hello, sorry for my late reply. I upgraded my phone about a month ago and forgot to sign back into reddit. Dr Hu does still offer the treatment. I however ended up not being a candidate as after I had my esophageal monomentry done it showed I only had about 30% of my swallowing function. Had she done the procedure on me I would have had 0% ability to swallow and would have needed a feeding tube until the botox wore off. It was super disappointing but I'm also great UL that she caught it. Now I'm waiting to see more specialists.

Honestly I have no difficulty swallowing and I've never experienced any reflux. I was quite surprised at the results. Apparently I have a weakened LES which may be contributing to the issue.

Title    : I think I’ve figured out a link between no burp, migraines, and tinnitus.
Selftext :
I feel like I've figured out a major link between no burp, migraines, and tinnitus. 
I have been a life long no burper and about 7 years ago I was diagnosed with chronic migraines. In the process of getting diagnosed for migraines I was also diagnosed with mild tinitus (constant ringing in the ears) which has gotten worse over the last year or 2. I have been on a couple of medications which have helped suppress the migraines but haven't fixed the issues 100%. Over the last year I have been paying more and more attention as to when I have a migraine come on and I have noticed that it seems to happen more often when I am also dealing with symptoms of R-CPD. Especially major bloating which causes me to have shallow breathing. Well long story short, the current medication I'm on for the migraines seems to not be working anymore. I noticed that when I actively make an effort to take deeper breathes that this lessens the intensity of the migraine and oddly enough the ringing in my ears. So I started to research if there was a link between lack of oxygen to the brain due to shallow breathing and migraines. Turns out there is. There is also research that lack of oxygen contributes to tinnitus. 

So, because R-CPD is causing me to have major bloating issues, it's leading me to have difficulties breathing properly and taking in the oxygen my body needs. Because of this, it is possible that there is a lack of oxygen in my blood stream and a lack of oxygen getting to my brain which in turn could be causing my chronic migraines and tinnitus. 

Anyways, of course I am not a Doctor and this is all just a theory. Just thought I would share it here and see if anyone else has any thoughts on this, or if anyone else who struggles with the same problems might share similar insights?

Interesting! For me I was very close to being able to get botox, I was 2 weeks away from the procedure but the results from a monometry test revealed that I only had 30% of my swallowing function so if the performed the botox on me it would completely paralyze my swallowing function and I would need a feeding tube until it wore off. Unfortunately I don't have the option of ruling it out with botox. Currently waiting to see more specialists to talk about other options.

Oh you'll do fine! I won't sugar coat it... It was the most unpleasant test that I've gone for for R-CPD, uncomfortable and it trips your gag reflex. Just remember to breath and you'll get through it before you know it.

It's a similar concept to that one. The probe is a bit thicker and it goes all the way down to your stomach. I was never not able to breath and the tech was alway good about taking a break if I needed it. Don't think I ever choked either, just gagged.

The majority of my migraines are also silent. I rarely experience one that actually has the pounding headache with it. I was shocked when I was diagnosed with them to find out that that was actually what was going on. I do also experience the goose bump thing. I didn't really think much of it until you brought it up. I kind of just thought it was normal but maybe it has something to do with lack of oxygen as well? Or our body reoxygenating?

The vertigo is 100% a migraine symptom. This was actually my first symptom I experienced when I was trying to get diagnosed. They knew it was some sort of vertigo but couldn't induce it like normal bpv vertigo. I was sent for all sorts of MRI'S and other scans to rule out tumours. This went on for 2 Years before I was finally referred to a neurologist who diagnosed me with chronic migraines, he said that was what was 100% causing this. Put me on medication for it and I didn't experience it again for another 2 Years after that until the meds stopped working.

Title    : Does anyone also have a really sensitive gag reflex?
Selftext :
First of all, I cannot believe this is a real thing, googling “why does my body make weird gurgling frog noises after eating” comes up with nothing related to R-CPD. Also the extreme bloating and ungodly flatulence. I knew it was abnormal but for the life of me couldn’t figure out what the hell it is.

So anyway, does anybody else have a really sensitive gag reflex? I’ve always had it bad since I was a child, but nowadays I gag even at the *thought* of eating breakfast (only breakfast though). Near the end of my meal, I end up not being able to finish it because I keep gagging when trying to eat it (I notice this a lot with yogurt, but it happens with lots of other things I eat too). I’m not necessarily full at all though, I just gag. Weird cooking smells make me gag, but I don’t gag when my cat takes a really smelly shit, maybe it’s because I’m used to it, but I’d imagine I should be used to weird cooking smells too, considering it’s all my family eats.

Lastly, does anyone know how rare this condition is? Considering it wasn’t even a diagnosable condition until 2019, I’d imagine it must be quite rare.

Title    : Why do many of us have emetophobia?
Selftext :
I’ve always wondered what the correlation was between emetophobia and R-CPD. Inability to burp turns into fear of vomiting. Why is this?

Although I don’t have a more logical explanation for it, I still relate. I hate the feeling of nausea. It’s kinda paradoxical, but if my body is feeling weird/nauseous I will make myself throw up (only if I feel like there’s nothing that can be done to make the nausea go away) to get rid of the nausea that I don’t like. That doesn’t mean I like actually vomiting though, I hate it too, just not as much as the nausea part. 

But I’ve realized just how strong this phobia is for me - it really comes out with *other* people vomiting. If I hear someone that just coughs or make noises in a certain way (like trying to get phlegm out), I immediately want to leave. This is especially true in a bathroom. If I can’t leave (because I’m in the bathroom doing my business), I will plug my ears with my fingers and hope it goes away. I would be willing to not wash my hands at all just to get out of there as fast as possible.

Anybody have explanations? I’d love to figure this out lol.

Title    : If you got the Botox and were successful: how old were you when you got the procedure, and how many units of Botox?
Selftext :
Hey all! I heard that as you get older, the Botox (especially smaller units) may be less effective, contributing to multiple doses needed. I’m considering seeing a doctor for treatment in the near future, and I would really hope it would work the first time since I’m not the most financially well off.

I’m about to turn 21 so I’m still really young - I’m hoping it’ll work for me! I’m considering seeing Dr. Villari in Bellevue, WA but I heard he does smaller units. If anybody has gotten the procedure done by him, I would love to know your results.

Thank you for the update! I’m really considering getting the treatment done in the near future, I’m also in my 20’s.

Embarrassing story… me and my friends were going to a rave and decided to have some fun drinking a bit. We used sodas as a chaser (BAD IDEA FOR ME! Why did I ever do that).

Near the middle to end of the concert, I was nauseous and couldn’t enjoy myself anymore. My friend had to help me throw up because of my emetophobia, plus it’s hard for me to throw up in general. What’s funny is, all that happened was I let out a HUGEEEE burp and threw up just a little bit. Felt much better after. Sooo.. likely was sick from the soda carbonation built up, not alcohol lol!

It was quite embarrassing to tell my friends that I was probably this sick because of soda, of all the things I drank. Definitely wanna get this awful condition treated soon.

I can, but I am fairly certain I have emetophobia because I try to avoid it at all costs, even if I know I’ll feel better… if I’m trying to force myself to vomit, I don’t usually have the balls to do it because it’s always been extremely violent and painful. Even when I do attempt to make myself vomit by making myself gag, it’s so hard for anything to come out for some reason. It just leads to a lot of dry heaving and discomfort because I’m stuck being nauseous without any vomit to make the nausea feeling go away. Gagging myself multiple times with no results is not pleasant.

Actually the last time I vomited, my best friend had to stick her fingers in my throat to help me while I cried. All that came out was a HUGE burp-ish (from drinking too much soda as chasers) and vomited just a tiny bit. I’m certain it has to be related to RCPD because of how difficult it is to get anything to go up through my throat, whether it be a burp or vomit.

Title    : New diagnosis... Kind of
Selftext :
I met with a new primary care doctor yesterday for an annual wellness review. I brought up the fact that I can't burp (as well as some of the other lovely side effects) to ask if she knew of any specialists in the area who could treat me for it. She had never heard of it, fair enough, she wanted to refer me to a gastroenterologist. I respectfully declined, knowing from my research that most diagnostic tests are not necessary or helpful. The symptoms of R-CPD are so specific that over 99% of people can correctly self-diagnose (per Dr. Bastian). I mentioned Dr. Bastian and his clinic in Chicago, she counseled me a little on risk/reward of a procedure like this and ended up encouraging me to go to Dr. Bastian's clinic and said to let her know if I needed a referral. All in all, I thought it went pretty well.

About 10 minutes later I get an email with a link to view the Dr's note. She diagnosed me with "chronic hiccup..." lol. I mentioned painful hiccups once, saying that they happen once every month or two. I contacted her to try to get it changed to retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction or inability to burp. But man is it discouraging to explain the problem to a doctor who you think is listening only to find out later they latched on to a relatively minor side effect instead of the actual problem. Not to mention what she's going to end up billing me for.... (yay US healthcare system).

Anyway, thanks for reading the rambling. Feels good to get it off my chest.

I recommend you check out laryngopedia dot com, click "Can't burp? You've come to the right place," and then scroll down to the webinars, I think what I reference is Q&A Part 1 but they're honestly all worth at least checking out. I don't want to put words in Dr. Bastian's mouth, but from what I remember he said that most diagnostic tests are not necessary or helpful. The symptoms are so specific that most people are able to self-diagnose correctly. I think he said in one of the videos that (at that time) he had done over 1000 Botox treatments for R-CPD and he had only ever encountered one or two patients who came to him thinking they had it but ended up having a different problem. Save your money- depending on where you live and your insurance it might be cheaper to travel to Chicago to have Dr. Bastian do the procedure compared to years of unnecessary tests and referrals as you say.

Title    : Anyone else?
Selftext :
Does anyone else have patulous Eustachian tubes? This is where you feel like your ears are plugged but you can't pop them, and you can hear your heart beating, your breathing and your voice sounds loud and muffled when you speak. Everything else around you is super muffled as well. It goes away when the head is tilted back like when you lay down, and happens sporadically but usually happens when you exercise or get sick. (What's really happening is a tube in your middle ear is supposed to be closed but briefly opens when you "pop" your ears but with this it just... stays open). 

I get it sometimes, and it always seems to come at the same time as bad gurgles... Hopkins website has a history of acid reflux as a potential cause which I definitely experience due R-CPD. I'm curious if anyone else has this. Also not funny but kind of funny... this tube in my ear is too loose and my lower esophageal sphincter is too tight... they should just swap.

Prob too late now but maybe for next time! I hope you had the best time ever!

I go to a lot of fests and the most impactful change I've made is not drinking during the day. It's also obvi good for the rest of your body too and helps with stamina a TON. Especially for camping fests.

I want to preface this next part by saying I am not a doctor.

* I get zofran from my primary care doctor and take it as needed. Just keep in mind that zofran does effect serotonin levels, so be extra careful w/ anything else that can change serotonin levels if u catch my drift. 
* Simethicone can help a lot with gas. 
* I use famotidine and TUMS for antacids but not interchangeably. 
   * TUMS can work instantly but only last for 20-30 minutes. They can also cause gas, since the active ingredient (calcium carbonate) works by neutralizing the stomach acid that's already there. Think vinegar mixing with baking soda.
   * Famotidine starts working in about an hour and can last for 10-12 hours. It works by blocking histamine receptors which limits the amount of stomach acid made in the first place. It can also help a little bit with allergies and is non-sedating like other antihistamines.

Usually, I am suuuper self-conscious about air-vomiting but the nice thing about doing it at a fest is that usually the music is so loud no-one else can hear it lol

The first time I air vomited was when I was coming up at a music festival. I think it was the e combined with the vibrations from the music that knocked the air out of me. I was horrified because I thought I was throwing up in the crowd, but nope, only air came out. Once I realized what had happened and how much better I felt I was absolutely overjoyed (for several reasons lol). Now it happens every time I roll. It's still scary to feel the air vomiting coming because it's completely involuntary (whereas every other time I do it I really have to push it out) but nothing but air has ever come out. Another thing I'm thankful for is that when it happens in the crowd the music is loud enough to drown out the exorcism noises coming out of me lmfao

There is also a lot of serotonin thats made in the gut (it helps with peristalsis aka moving food along  your intestines) so I suspect that's another cause. Just a theory though! A friend of mine who can burp says she always does when she comes up.

I notice that my gurgles get worse when I'm stressed/anxious. Maybe going on an anti-anxiety medication would help, along with learning stress/anxiety management coping skills. I imagine breathing exercises can be especially impactful.

If that's not up your alley, there are medications that can help with the physiology. Over the counter meds I find helpful are famotidine (antacid) and simethicone (anti-gas). In a pinch I will use zofran (you do need a prescription for it but it's quite common), which is an anti-emetic (anti nausea) medication.

Title    : Midwest Center for Day Surgery and Jewelry
Selftext :
Hi! I have my botox appointment in 2 weeks (yay!) and am looking through the packets sent by Bastian Voice Institute for prep. I'm seeing that the Midwest Center for Day Surgery requests that all body piercings be removed. Most of my jewelry can be removed at home, but I have 3 that I would want to go to a piercer to remove (tragus, forward helix, nose ring) if they had to come out. Before I call to ask, has anyone been able to keep their jewelry in for the botox procedure?

I'm 25 and diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia and patulous eustachian tubes.

I've never given much thought to whether rcpd affects my fatigue, but it's possible. I have been taking modafinil for it for a couple years and that has helped immensely.

I have wondered if rcpd affects the eustachian tubes, because every time I get a flare up in my ears, the gurgles are always terrible. Like the worst it can possibly get. I think the full feeling in your ears causes you to instinctually swallow in an attempt to get the ear back to normal, but what ends up happening is you swallow a lot of air... This is just my theory. An ENT told me drinking a lot of water and consuming a lot of sodium can help with patulous eustachian tubes, something about swelling the tissue in the ear which encourages the tube to stay closed like it's supposed to. 

I am scheduled to get the botox with Dr. Bastian in a couple weeks, I am planning to ask him about the eustachian tube thing. I will also be paying attention to both of these issues to see if they change/improve over time. I'll report back :)

I almost never airvom in public because it's SO loud and I'm afraid if anyone overhears it, they'll try to call 911 or something but I will do it at concerts or festivals.  The music is so loud that it covers the sound up (at least at the concerts I go to which are mostly edm). I used to go into the porta potties to do it in case anything actually came up. Now I'm comfortable doing it in the crowd, I'll just make sure to cover my mouth with a pashmina and make it like a cough or duck down like I'm tying my shoe, so people don't think I'm about to throw up. Nothing but air has ever come out!

I also have famotidine on deck which is an antacid (and doesn't produce gas like TUMS can). And simethicone for gas. And if it's extra bad, zofran.

Other obvious ones are avoiding carbonation, not eating too much or anything too greasy before, avoiding certain medications/drugs...

The nausea hits me extremely quick so when I feel it coming on, I cough hard in the crook of my arm with the pash covering. It's kind of gross but if you make your mouth mimic the motion of vomiting while coughing/clearing your throat it tricks your body into getting the air up. It does for me, at least. 

Benefit of doing it in a porta potty is the nastiness of the inside of those things is enough to make you dry heave, no fingers required. Try to over exaggerate the motions to encourage the air to come out. It's probably a good idea to start off in a porta potty or other private area for the first few times so you gain the confidence that nothing else comes up. Also I always carry hand sani in case I do end up using my fingers.

Totally feel you. I think the more you successfully airvomit, the more you associate it with feeling better afterward and the easier it will get. If that's off the table though, stomach massage might help. Do it in a clockwise motion, laying down if possible. It can help the air come out the other way

I'm sitting at my desk and every time I take a sip of coffee or water I feel myself burping which has been such a relief. My question now is can my coworkers/cubicle neighbors hear me? I keep my mouth closed but have been encouraging them to come up by tipping my head down/to the side because I know I'm supposed to practice. If so, is there a way to quiet them down?

I got the botox around 3 weeks ago. I do sometimes get surprised by an unexpected burp, but it's totally different from what I expected. Most burps (except after a meal or drinking carbonation) are quite small and quiet if not silent. I was super self-conscious about the uncontrolled burps but I kept asking my boyfriend "did you hear that??" and he said no so I don't worry about it so much anymore.  Just keep your mouth closed when you feel the air coming up. You learn pretty quickly which movements will let a burp slip out quietly and which ones cause a cartoon burp.

Even if I did have loud uncontrolled burps for 3 months it would still be worth it because the relief is so stark.

Title    : Patulous Eustachian Tubes and No-Burp: Botox Cured Both!
Selftext :
Hi! I have what are called patulous eustachian tubes. This means I sometimes get a full feeling in my ears (like they need to pop but can't) and experience autophony (I can hear myself breathe, my voice sounds loud in my ears and my hearing is affected). Others who have PET also experience tinnitus. The issue is that the eustachian tubes are supposed to be closed at rest, only opening a couple times per hour to equalize pressure and drain fluid, but instead, mine stay open. It isn't dangerous, but it can be extremely bothersome/annoying/distracting. Just like not being able to burp!

I saw an ENT to try to find treatment for the PET but she basically told me unless my symptoms were debilitating and I wanted surgery, the best thing to do is to eat a high salt diet and drink a lot of water. PET happens when there is decreased pressure on the eustachian tube, increasing the chances of them staying open. One of the main ways this happens is dehydration. When adequately hydrated, the tissue in the ear takes up more space, increasing the pressure and encouraging the tube to stay closed as it's supposed to. When you're dehydrated, the fix is a lot of water and a lot of salts/electrolytes to help retain the water.

The problem is, when experiencing PET symptoms, the body subconsciously starts hypersalivating and swallowing air (imagine being on a plane and trying to pop your ears for hours at a time) which is a recipe for an RCPD flare up. Drinking a lot of salt water is the last thing you want to do once the gurgles/nausea/bloating starts. So what happens is you can't hear much of anything going on around you, only what's going on inside your body, you feel like your ears need to pop or are infected causing hypersalivation and swallowed air, you get the gurgles, become nauseous... It's a bad time. 

I had read that the eustachian tubes connect the middle ear to the back of the throat and wondered if there was any correlation between PET and RCPD. When I saw Dr. Bastian to get the Botox in February (4ish months ago) I asked him, and he said no, he had not noticed a correlation. I didn't think about the connection again until now and realized something really cool.

Now (after Botox) the PET flareups are less common because I can drink water without getting nauseous. When I do get flareups I start burping, so there's no nausea. Then, I'm able to drink electrolyte water (32oz+!!) right away, burp more, and experience relief in my ears within 30 minutes vs hours or days. It seems so obvious to me in hindsight, but by treating my RCPD with Botox I also happened to pretty much wipe out my PET.

Hopefully this reaches someone with PET and RCPD. If not, let this be an example of how **getting the Botox can improve your life in totally unexpected ways.** If you're on the fence, go for it!

My ENT told me unless a person is actively experiencing PET symptoms, everything looks normal. I wasn't having a flare up at the time of my appointment so she couldn't diagnose me based on what she saw, but once I explained the symptoms, she was able to rule everything else out. I think one of the big indicators was that when I was having a flare up, laying down immediately caused the symptoms to go away (for as long as I was in that position). I guess when you lay down there is more pressure on the eustachian tubes. I had also recently gone to an urgent care doctor who prescribed me steroids, which made it worse. I had also had my primary care doctor tell me to take flonase which also made it worse.

The ears not popping thing stuck out to me. I also have this problem (it did not go away after I got the botox). I was diagnosed with patulous eustachian tubes. It might be worth looking into, especially if being horizontal temporarily fixes it and steroids (like flonase) make it worse.

I also have eustachian tube issues! When you went to the ENT were you actively experiencing symptoms? If no, it could look normal. I was diagnosed with patulous eustachian tubes (they feel like they need to pop but they're actually stuck in the open position). It's especially bad when I'm sick or working out. Look into that and see if it resonates. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot you can do for it, but staying hydrated and consuming a lot of sodium (per the ENT) can help the tube stay shut as it's supposed to be. It helps me. 

I will say that when I had a patulous eustachian tube flare up before the botox it was miserable- I'd swallow air subconsciously trying to normalize the pressure in my ear which would make the gurgles go crazy. I'd get nauseous and on top of that couldn't hear anything around me. Post botox I don't notice as many issues with my ears, plus now when I do start to get the sensation in my ear, I pound an LMNT packet in 32oz water and it goes away! Laying horizontally also helps the eustachian tube close, but only as long as you're horizontal so that's not the most helpful solution lol.

Ugh I'm sorry. My experience with my (US) ENT was also extremely discouraging and I had to do so much advocating for myself/prior research to get the info I needed. Luckily, I am in healthcare, so I wasn't able to push back against her dismissiveness. You would hope they would ask the right questions but... 

I'm a dietitian, not a doctor but it might be worth trying omeprazole or famotidine to decrease stomach acid production. If you were experiencing silent reflux or LPR it would help. TUMS can also help, although they can sometimes cause issues with bloating for people with RCPD and reduce existing stomach acid, rather than preventing production in the first place.

Good luck! Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy, fatty and citrus foods before the flight. Careful with the gum chewing since it can (as you know) make the RCPD worse. If you are able to get the botox you should absolutely do it. It was a life changer!

Since you live close, I would try to become an established patient at BVI so you can get a pre-authorization. I don't remember the exact details, but I think part of my claim was denied because I wasn't able to get it since I live out of state.

Title    : Botox = done! Now what?!
Selftext :
Had a wonderful experience getting my Botox with Dr. Carroll and his very compassionate team today. Couldn’t have gone any better - I truly felt like I was in the best hands the whole time. Shout out to the other Redditor who was also getting the procedure today! Wishing you a speedy recovery!! 

Currently (7 hours post-op) dealing with a sore throat and obviously kind of out of it for the anesthesia. Other than the intense symptoms I was experiencing on the daily for my entire life from R-CPD, I also chose to do the procedure to hopefully relieve some of my emetophobia. I haven’t thrown up in over 20 years and part of me is worried that this procedure is going to make it much easier for me to get sick, which I guess is a good thing (?) but not in my brain. Emetophobia truly rules my life (can’t eat out, don’t do well in cars, restrictive diet, daily panic) and I’m hoping that by relieving some of the nausea I experience from R-CPD I won’t have that at the forefront of my brain. 

Anyone else with emetophobia notice a difference after surgery? Am I suddenly going to start getting sick again? Or, best case scenario, will I resume having a stomach of steel and just have less nausea? Dr Carroll assured me I wouldn’t suddenly shift into throwing up all of the time but I have to ask the people 😂

Thanks y’all!

Congrats on conquering emetophobia!! The fear of throwing up once Botox kicks in almost  stopped me from getting the procedure but I went through with it this morning and am excited for what’s to come. I definitely agree that emetophobes bodies tend to get sick less, so I’m glad you didn’t have a ton of throwing up with the bugs - but equally glad to hear that when it happened it wasn’t traumatic. I honestly tear up thinking of getting sick and it not being scary…what a feat that would be. 
Take care!!

I have tried CBT, EMDR (briefly), and IFS approaches for my emetophobia and all helped but in different ways. I think for me Botox (just got it 3 days ago) is like the last step since so many of my symptoms are real and associated with R-CPD. It’s like I did the mental work first and now I’m doing the physical.

IFS is internal family systems! So basically learning all different parts of yourself. I worked a lot with the younger version of me who felt neglected and overlooked when I was sick, and healing the pain “she” went through.

Title    : One week post Botox and I need a pep talk! 
Selftext :
Got my Botox on 7/25 at Brigham and Women’s. Great experience, and I have been burping!
At least I think I am. I can only do it when I turn my head and look over my shoulder. Sometimes it sounds just like my old gurgles, but that they are releasing. Sometimes I get a big gas bubble, turn my head, and then relax my jaw and it comes out. They don’t sound traditional but I can tell they’re burps because they either taste like what I ate or have an almost hot/acidic “feeling” to them after drinking carbonation. I’m super emetophobic so this has been hard for me (exposure therapy every 5 min). Is it normal for my burps to almost burn? My husband said his dont so I’m concerned.  There’s no acid coming up but I’m sure it’s not far behind…any advice?

Also any tips for relieving my neck and shoulder pain from constantly turning? I try my best to avoid it but sometimes it’s the only thing that helps.

It will get easier! I’m emetophobic too and 11 days post op…after the first week you get the hang of the sensations. Everyday is like exposure therapy though, and honestly I feel like it’s already helping my phobia! Just be patient with your body and try to approach burping with ease - I notice when I push it is when the uncomfy sensations start.

Title    : Dry burps to wet…back to square one? (13 days post Botox)
Selftext :
After one week I was dealing with some slow swallow but was finally getting satisfying burps out. The burps tasted normal (sorry I know that’s gross) and it was relieving. Now, a week later (2 weeks post Botox) my burps taste like acidic gas and i feel everything hanging in my throat. I started omeprazole after surgery and am taking Pepcid once a day but my biggest issue is the reflux feels like it’s preventing me from burping like i was. When I try to burp or release air (sometimes it’s just a waft of acid air with no noise) I end up feeling some regurgitation and panic and I lose the burp OR it comes up a bit wet. Will this subside? I’m worried I won’t “learn” how to burp since this is preventing me from really letting it out and by the time the reflux is gone I will have missed my chance. 
Any advice? I’m feeling a little less hopeful than I was a week ago, but trying to remember this is not an instant fix…

Title    : Acid reflux suppressing burps post Botox? 
Selftext :
Had Botox five weeks ago. Love burping…except says like today…
I drank an espresso (I always do decaf because caffeine makes my reflux flare up) and pretty soon after realized I had f’ed up. I ate a Caesar salad for lunch and since then it’s all I can taste. Every burp tastes terrible and it’s nauseating. The coffee seems to have really elevated my acid reflux (which has been moderate with some severe days since Botox) and I can’t kick it. I feel like I have burps trapped by the reflux. I took a Pepcid (and a zofran because I feel honestly ill when I taste these burps, but I have so much gas that I can’t NOT burp) but wondering if acid can interfere with burp production?

My reflux has gotten worse in the last week which is suppressing my burps or making them “wet” which makes me really nauseous.

Recovery from Botox is like mini exposure therapy sessions everyday. I don’t think about my emetophobia like I used to. For example, I just went to a huge fair and only had a moment thinking someone might be sick once and I ate all of the foods I wanted, where before Botox my anxiety would’ve been through the roof and I would’ve hardly eaten. It really has changed my life. I think I may need a second round as it’s getting harder to burp again but I’m still able to get enough out that I’m not nauseous all the time.

Title    : 2 months post Botox…did it fail? 
Selftext :
Hi all. Had Botox on 7/25 and felt nearly instant relief. I have had many burps since, but in the last few weeks I have had a hard time burping and am mostly regurgitating or getting silent passes of air (which are great but pretty small). The only way I can get gas to move is drinking carbonation, but sometimes that causes more pain than relief. I feel like my burps have been more like released gurgles, and I don’t feel that same vibration that others seem to, but I’m sure that has to do with the muscle being paralyzed? 
I’m feeling defeated. I’ve had more bad days than good lately. Is this typical? I am hoping healing isn’t linear in this case and it’s okay to go backwards a little bit. 

PS if you’re reading this and debating Botox please don’t think twice - I would get this procedure 15 more times if it meant I could feel the relief I have felt!!

Title    : First Noro Season Post Botox
Selftext :
First Noro season after RCPD Treatment

Long time emetophobe here…haven’t thrown up since I was ~15 (am currently 34). I have RCPD and got Botox for treatment this summer. My symptoms have improved a ton, but the anxiety and emetophobia is creeping back up quickly with noro season. I have deleted most social media platforms because it’s all I am seeing. Of course I go into work today and it’s the first focus of our admin meeting. It just feels inescapable. 

 I know that people with RCPD tend to throw up less due to the muscle dysfunction, so I’m worried that now that my muscle is relaxed it will happen easier (which I guess is a good thing if it happens, but I wish my body could just suppress it). I work in a school and my son is in school for the first time so I have a feeling we are going to be screwed this year. I am wanting to take a leave of absence and not leave the house and worry I’m starting to instill my anxiety into my son (he has to wash his hands as soon as he comes home and will ask why so I explain it - I try not to be fear mongering but want to be sure he’s being as hygienic as possible). I guess I’m just looking for comfort as many of you are also emetophobic.

Thanks for this! I think having gone almost 20 years without getting sick I have completely forgotten what the sensation is (like post Botox I realized so much of what I thought was true nausea was really trapped gas!) 
I’m lucky enough to have a zofran script on hand for times where I feel sick, so that’s a huge safety blanket for me. Unfortunately that doesn’t help my kiddo but helps me to feel better and be supportive for him during those times. 
Thanks for your answer - it helped me quite a bit :)

Hey fellow noburpers.  I’m getting so desperate for relief.  I found out about Dr. Bastian and the Botox procedure right before I got pregnant.  I’m now breastfeeding my 6 month old.

Welcome to the NoBurp family!  I agree that just knowing there are others like us out there makes us feel more at ease.  

I’ve seen 3 different PCPs about my issues.  Seen a GI specialist.  Had an EGD.  And been put on the FODMAP diet to decrease the amount of gas my stomach creates.  Nothing helped… Ended up with a diagnosis of IBS and GERD.  It’s so extremely frustrating.  I work at a University Hosptial in the OR and broke down and emailed one of the ENT surgeons about my R-CPD.  She immediately responded and said she’s more than willing to see me and treat me with Botox in an effort to help me.  My appointment is Dec 9.  It cannot get here soon enough.  Until then, I’ll continue to be extremely uncomfortable, bloated, and gurgle like crazy.  

As far as the GI doc telling you to be skeptical… ignore that.  They literally have no idea what you’re dealing with on a daily basis.  That makes me so angry.  Go see an ENT doctor and bring with you all the information on Dr. Bastian’s research and treatment for R-CPD.  I included all of that in my email to this surgeon and in her response she said she knows him well and knows all about his research.  I feel so validated and so hopeful.  I’m hoping you’ll find a doctor willing to try it.

Omg. I’m seeing an ENT specialist in Arkansas.  I’m the first patient she’s treating with this condition.  She has read up on a lot of Bastian’s studies and has been so wonderful.  I went in for the Botox, but as soon as she saw my distended esophagus she was caught off guard because to her it was extremely abnormal.  She only injected 10 units of Botox that day because she was worried I had other issues we didn’t know about.  She’s sending me for a lot of other tests before injecting more. Reading your post and these comments make me feel so much better knowing that for us nonburpers it’s normal.  I need to share this information with her.  Thank you so so much for sharing your experience.

Yes!!!!  I have them around 2 or 3 times a day.  Usually mine only happen once at a time, sometimes twice.  Also, it tends to happen after I eat.  Never thought it could be related to RCPD, but it makes complete sense.

Did you end up getting Botox?  I’m in Arkansas also and have started the process with an ENT in Little Rock.  I’m the first person she’s treating with RCPD, but it’s looking promising.

Thank you!  I’m excited to see him discuss it on that webinar.  I may just forward that over to my doctor, too.  

Also, what’s crazy is that the 10 units actually helped for a little while!  I had to do the whole “stretch my neck and turn my head to the side thing”, but I still had burps coming out.  Of course it wore off super quick, though.

I don’t blame you.  I probably would have waited also.  

I’m seeing Dr. Ozlem Tulunay at UAMS.  She’s been wonderful.  I went in for the procedure and when she inserted the scope she was super shocked at how distended my esophagus was and felt kind of uncomfortable injecting a lot of Botox not know exactly what was going on with my anatomy.  She injected a little bit and is having me go through a bunch of tests before injecting more.  I’m totally fine with it, but I also learned since then that dilation of our esophagus is extremely normal with RCPD.  Insurance is covering it all, so that’s a huge plus too!

Title    : What do you do when you can’t get any relief?
Selftext :
I’m in the process of getting the Botox, but my doctor is having me go through all kinds of tests first.  I have no issues with this because insurance is going to cover it.  My problem is that all my symptoms are getting worse.  There are some evenings that I can’t get any relief no matter what I do.  Gas relief medicine, air vomit, stretching… nothing helps and I’m absolutely miserable.  If any of you have any other tips or advice I’d love to hear them.

I don’t drink anything carbonated, but I do drink a lot of tea.  I’ve heard that can be bad for reflux, but do you think it could be bad for RCPD, too?

I appreciate your concern.  I went in for the Botox procedure a couple months ago and my esophagus was so distended that she didn’t feel comfortable moving forward not knowing if I had other issues going on.  So I got sent for a swallow study and am having a manometry and 24hr reflux test next week.  I did email her the webinar link where he explains esophagus distention.  I discovered that here after all of that happened. 

I work in the OR with this ENT doctor, but to be honest I am her very first R-CPD patient.  She was familiar with it and was familiar with Bastian when I first brought it up.  That’s the only reason I feel comfortable moving forward with her.  It does make me feel a tad apprehensive knowing that she’s never treated it before, but I know that she is a really great provider and cares a lot for her patients.

Title    : Esophageal Motility Dysfunction?
Selftext :
The ENT I’ve been seeing sent me for ALLLLL the tests/procedures prior to trying Botox again - first time during surgery she only injected a tiny bit of Botox because she was shocked at how distended my esophagus is….  Anyway, after having the 24hr stomach pH test done and an esophageal manometry test done I’m told I have 100% esophageal motility dysfunction.  Basically my esophagus isn’t working.  The pH test revealed really bad reflux along with a large percentage of bolus reflux. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar?  I’m feeling defeated.

I honestly have no idea.  She’s sending all of my results to a couple of laryngology specialists to get their input.  She mentioned wondering if having a nissen procedure done would be beneficial, but we didn’t talk about it at length.

I know this is an old post, but I also have a non-functioning esophagus.  Mine doesn’t work at all which makes the risk of getting the Botox so much higher.  I was told if I got treated for R-CPD with the Botox I would most likely have constant reflux and bolus that would flow into my mouth.  What did you end up doing?

Hello.  I know this post is YEARS old, but I also have been diagnosed with esophageal dysmotility.  I was told if I got the Botox that I would probably have reflux and bolus (food) flow freely from my stomach to my mouth because there would be nothing at all to help keep it down.  Ugh.  Do you have any updates??
