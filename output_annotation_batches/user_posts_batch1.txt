Dr. Spiegel is his name. I just found this page recently and have been looking into all of this as well. Unfortunately, I have a lot of other health issues going on so trying to address my supposed RCPD is going on the back burner for the time being. But I would love to know the current step by step experience with Dr. Spiegel for when I try to see him for treatment. If it is not too much trouble, would you mind messaging me some updates, experiences or info while you pursue treatment? If not, I totally understand as it can be very personal. But, I figured that I would ask. Best of luck!

Why I rarely drink‚Ä¶it is such an awful feeling. Wish I had an answer to help but I have yet to find anything. Probably the same for most on here, hence the Botox injection procedure.

Abdominal pain and bloating every hour of every day of my life unfortunately. Never goes away and never eases up. Only burps I can manifest are air vomiting. I‚Äôve just learned to suffer with it. I can guarantee my insurance won‚Äôt cover any of the Botox treatment and it‚Äôs also a nightmare trying to do anything in Philadelphia which is where the closest Doctor is to me, that treats this. Not to mention if I even do decide to pay out of pocket and put myself in further debt that there is no guarantee the procedure will even fix my issue and may require the procedure to be done a second time costing even more money. So, I just continue to suffer ü´†

Well, it actually started as legitimate vomiting for quite some time. I get so nauseous from the gas/air buildup that I just let my body get to the point of vomiting but I have learned to basically stop it right before the point of actually releasing vomit lol. The gas/air is sitting above the contents of your stomach so that will release first in the process. Finding that threshold of stopping before anything else comes up takes some, usually unfortunate, practice of trying to control your body.

I am still a hit or miss sometimes. It‚Äôs a real fine line between air vomit and actual vomit. If I swallow air and let it sit in my throat, it sometimes can cause a violent burp (this is how most people burp on command I believe) but for those of us who can‚Äôt, I find that it can trigger air vomiting. Although I have noticed that swallowing air to force the air vomit leads to closer calls of actually vomiting for me rather than letting my body just try and do it when the urge is overwhelming.

Title    : First appt with Dr. Spiegel tomorrow
Selftext :
Tomorrow is my first appointment to see Dr. Spiegel at Jefferson in Philadelphia. The receptionist was super friendly and knew exactly what I was talking about when I mentioned that I can‚Äôt burp which makes me happy. It‚Äôs clear that they deal with this more frequently than I thought. Giving me hopes that this Botox procedure will help if Dr. Spiegel decides that I am a good candidate. Anybody else who visited him, can you offer any insight on what to expect? Any information on your experience is welcome. I am even curious about costs as I have a strong feeling my insurance won‚Äôt want to cover much.

I had my first appointment with Dr. Spiegel today. The drive, through Philly, was a bit stressful as always but there is a parking garage right under the Honickman center where the office is located so that was good. Everybody was very friendly and the hospital is super modern and clean with a lot of touch screens everywhere lol. Dr. Spiegel is a bit quick and right to the point. No b.s. He was very friendly and informative though. He is also quite familiar with this Reddit page and other ‚ÄúNo Burp‚Äù groups which was good to hear. It‚Äôs nice seeing a doctor that is in touch with the community that is suffering from this. He decided it would be beneficial for me to try the Botox treatment. I was surprised to hear him say that one of the biggest symptoms he looks for is chronic bloating. I was real happy to hear that as it‚Äôs my worst symptom. I am now awaiting a phone call to schedule the procedure and get information to contact my insurance company so I can figure out what they will cover.

Title    : Botox procedure costs with United Healthcare

Just a heads up for anyone with United Healthcare, my cost for the Botox procedure with Dr. Spiegel at Jefferson Philadelphia is around $1300 out of pocket. This is with all of my deductibles met.

I just had the Botox injection done on Monday 8/5/24 under General Anesthesia. The process itself was nothing to worry about. I don‚Äôt even remember going under. Just waking up in the recovery area with a slightly sore throat and I mean slightly. Wasn‚Äôt even sore enough to affect my eating. All soreness is gone now and I am just dealing with a bit of the slow swallow currently. I can equate it to the feeling of my throat just being a little swollen. I just keep plenty of water on hand while eating if it feels like any food is moving a bit too slow. I also have been eating slower and with smaller bites. It‚Äôs not terrible though or enough to make me panic as I really struggle with any type of choking sensations. If this is the worse the symptoms will get from the procedure, then I am totally okay with it.

Title    : 3 Days Post Botox Injection
Selftext :
Got my Botox injection done under general anesthesia with Dr. Spiegel 3 days ago at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. So far I have been experiencing the slow swallow but I‚Äôve been burping randomly throughout the day quite frequently now. I‚Äôve also been able to turn my throat gurgles into burps by leaning forward and extending my neck out as far as possible whenever I feel the gurgles coming up. They are small burps but they have literally never happened before. Super happy so far. I really hope this progress continues and big burps start to happen soon!

Try and drink carbonated drinks and things to make you burp as well. Also bending and moving your neck around seems to help as well. The goal, as most seem to agree on, is to try and train your body on how to burp since the muscle is not used to doing it.

I am 5 days post Botox and my throat feels the same way. I‚Äôve been trying different ways to get burps to come up and the best I have found so far is to extend my neck and chin all the way out in front of me kind of like how a chicken does when it walks lol. I‚Äôve been doing that every time I feel a gurgle come up my throat and it releases a burp. They aren‚Äôt super satisfying burps that have relieved my bloating but they feel better than the gurgles just going back down.

I had the Botox injection with Dr. Spiegel. I have been burping very frequently and it almost feels like a normal thing now. Unfortunately, I am still bloated but I might have some other underlying issue that is contributing to the bloating as I have had Gastro issues most of my life. I will say that a lot of the extreme pressure from the bloating seems to have dissipated. So it‚Äôs not a complete loss as of now. Some people have claimed it took longer for the bloating to go away so I‚Äôm holding out a bit of hope still. The best improvement is the stomach gurgles that used to be endless are now turning into burps which is great.

Title    : A little over 3 weeks post Botox injection
Selftext :
So I am not burping as much as I was the first two weeks after the injection but I am still burping. I have not seen any improvement in my severe bloating which sucks but I‚Äôm still holding out a little hope. The main areas of improvement I have seen are the gas pains and stomach/throat gurgles. The gas pains have definitely dissipated a noticeable amount which is great. The majority of my stomach/throat gurgles that normally would get stuck have now turned into burps which is a wonderful feeling. So it‚Äôs not a total disappointment at this point. I am not entirely confident in the bloating going away which really sucks. As far as the burps themselves, they feel more like small-medium throat burps instead of deep guttural ones which I think would be far more satisfying.

Best of luck to you! My best recommendation is to have lots of liquid on hand while eating to help with the slow swallow. The injection makes your throat feel a little swollen while eating but water makes the food go right down. Also, I went right into carbonated drinks to help burp as much as possible. I‚Äôm not sure what others have done in regard to that.

I‚Äôve been struggling with severe bloating for so long and multiple Gastroenterologists have been not able to give me any answers. I also suffered from ‚Äúnoburp‚Äù When I heard about the Botox treatment, I was so excited but I guess I should have known better than to get my hopes up. Had the injection in the beginning of August and while I can actually burp now, I have not had an ounce of relief in my bloating. Not even a tiny bit. Super disappointing. The Botox was my last beacon of hope for finally finding some relief. I know it has helped a lot of people but I guess I am just unlucky.

If there is something else causing the bloating. I will never know what it is. I‚Äôve been through the ringer with 4 different gastroenterologists. Have had all sorts of scans, blood work and testing done. Also been tested and treated 3 different times for SIBO. No relief from any of it.

Been on a lowfod map diet for about a year... (which is NOT advised as it can leave you malnourished) it helped in the beginning because it takes out highly fermentable foods (gas producing) which i‚Äôd say is pretty important if you can‚Äôt burp but it hasn‚Äôt been a cure all. It can be hard to stick to and it‚Äôs quite expensive as well, but since it‚Äôs really decreased the amount I suffer it‚Äôs much easier to stick to

I would recommend calling Dr. Bastion‚Äôs institute and asking for their list of other doctors that may treat this disorder. My experience TRYING to see an ENT: I told the receptionist I couldn‚Äôt burp and she laughed at me and never scheduled anything and my GI doc completely disregarded it so... it‚Äôd be good to find someone familiar with the syndrome. A GI doc is most likely to put you on antispasmodic meds, acid reduction meds, have you go through many tests, a low fodmap diet, and just diagnose you with IBS (at least this is my and many others experiences)

So I read from others on here that doing these elimination diets didn‚Äôt really help in the long run and i‚Äôve been on a low fodmap diet for nearly a year. However, after reading those comments I stupidly went out and ate almost whatever and today i‚Äôm DYING. I know this is probably just because my body hasn‚Äôt digested these foods in so long but does anyone have advice? I should add that I have a phobia of vomiting so today is not faring well for me and i‚Äôm nauseous and having lower GI problems üò≠ Any advice or words of encouragement?

Title    : Cleveland Clinic ENT
Selftext :
Just wanted to share my experience with an initial appointment with an ENT at the Cleveland Clinic. I went in for RCPD, which he has never heard of, but he does treat dysfunction of that muscle with a botox injection. I was mostly baffled at his question of ‚Äúwhy do you think you need to burp‚Äù..... he‚Äôs the ENT, shouldn‚Äôt he know? He seemed pretty disinterested in actually helping me and suddenly said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna look at your throat‚Äù which I refused due to the suddenness and my emetophobia, which he also disregarded. He ordered 3 different tests, one of which is like a barium swallow (which I‚Äôve already had done), but with the aid of a speech therapist, something else I forget the name of, and an endoscopy with GI. I feel all these tests are a bit unnecessary, although I know the primary reason is to find proof of esophageal dysfunction for insurance purposes. My mother and I are still thinking about going to Illinois but we‚Äôve agreed on getting an endoscopy done here, in my hometown. 
I personally would prefer going to Chicago and getting this done by people that understand the condition and seem to actually care about their patients, but we have yet to decide that. Anyways, that‚Äôs my experience with the Cleveland Clinic ENT doctor.

It‚Äôll probably come back, but welcome to all of our daily lives and struggles. I‚Äôve never been able to burp so I have no clue what it‚Äôs like to suddenly lose that ability, but fretting won‚Äôt help. The only thing that seems to help the discomfort is laying on your back when you feel you need to burp. Also if it‚Äôs only been 2 weeks I would‚Äôve even consider botox.

I believe a lot of us deal with chronic nausea and I‚Äôm wondering if it normally correlates with having to burp but being unable to.

Zofran is really just to prevent vomiting but I find I usually get some nausea relief for maybe 4 hours, there‚Äôs a study somewhere that looked at the effectiveness of zofran on feeling gaggy and it did help some people, it helps me sometimes.

Selftext :
I feel like THC helps the nausea quite a bit (I don‚Äôt really care for being high though) but I think I have better luck with edibles? Like it makes me feel less ‚Äúburpy‚Äù and gives me less unfavorable side effects of being high that are exasperated with RCPD. Does anyone also feel this way/what are some good strains you‚Äôve used for nausea?

Title    : When it's the worst
Selftext :
Although I have rcpd 100% zero doubt I only really struggle with it in social situations because i'm not being as conscientious of how much air i'm swallowing and I also find the problem to get MUCH worse if i'm drinking a ton of fluids quickly. Main takeaway is you might have a lot worse symptoms if you're talking and eating rather than in a quiet environment. Common sense, but not necessarily something we think about.

Title    : Emetaphobia lessening 
Selftext :
As most of us have established, there appears to be a very strong link with emetaphobia and RCPD. Due to heartbreak my phobia has taken a seat on the back burner, except when I truly feel sick, then i'm freaking out per usual. Anyways, what i've noticed is that for the first time in my life i've been getting quite a few micro burps. They don't make any noise or feel relieving but they taste like food air... a micro burp. They don't scare me at all even though they come out of nowhere and the only conclusion I can come to is that it has to do with my phobia taking a back seat, for now. I'll be 24 soon and all my life i've struggled with this so it's very strange indeed. I'm sure once the heartbreak is less my phobia will return to its natural status and perhaps I'll stop having these little burps (only time will tell). Anyways I just wanted to share this because maybe those of us with emetaphobia just working on the fear could be helpful, idk. I understand the mechanics of RCPD and the reason for botox, to retrain the muscle but maybe it's possible through other methods.

Title    : Botox for under $2k in the US
Selftext :
This post is going to be about pricing and not about my experience because I feel like there‚Äôs already a lot of that on here. And I feel like I‚Äôve seen multiple posts about people having trouble finding affordable providers. I‚Äôm 4 days post Botox. I flew to Chicago to see Dr. Bastian at Bastian Voice Institute. Just wanted to share what I paid on here because it was a lot more affordable than I thought it would be. Due to my symptoms, Dr. Bastian was 100% certain that I had RCPD and did not make me do the swallow test. What I‚Äôve heard is that he is the only one at Bastian voice Institute that will allow you to opt out of the swallow test & only if he is certain you have RCPD. So I can‚Äôt guarantee this for everyone but it definitely saved me some $. 

I ended up paying $335 for the consultation visit that day, and $1575 to the surgery center the next day. So out of pocket I paid $1950. & I got 100 units of Botox injected

Feeling so discouraged. I had in office procedure 2 weeks ago. I thought I was having microburps but now there‚Äôs literally nothing and I‚Äôm wondering if it was just my usual gurgles and my mind was just playing tricks on me. It really sucks, it‚Äôs like now that I know it‚Äôs possible for this to be fixed the idea of it NOT being fixed makes me feel severely anxious. I find myself getting annoyed when my partner burps. Like they‚Äôre showing off. 

I guess I just really got my hopes up and I‚Äôm so disappointed, not to mention all the things I would have rather spent ¬£850 on.

So the other day I posted feeling down about not having any burps and thinking it didn‚Äôt work. 

Well, just now I was annoyed. I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ I can feel them. So I thought I‚Äôd go to the bathroom and just try to force one. Basically I stood in my bathroom prepared to projectile vomit across the room. 

But what actually came out was a burp. Then another. Then I went to my office and did it again. 

I think it becomes easier as I become more confident that I won‚Äôt vomit. 

Still hoping for some automatic burps but at least I know what muscles are involved in burping now and hopefully I can practice.

Title    : 2nd Botox injection scheduled
Selftext :
I had my first injection in-office in September. 

It was immediately followed by a horrible ‚Äúcold.‚Äù I have a sneaking suspicion that the cold was actually my immune system attacking the Botox because my cold ended and so did any side effects from the Botox. E.g. I had slow swallowing, but that ended alongside the cold. 

So I‚Äôve never had a real burp. I can force an air vomit a bit less violently. But it‚Äôs clear it didn‚Äôt work. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm scheduled for a 2nd injection in December. Just wondering if anyone else had luck with this. I mostly figure chucking another ¬£200 at it won‚Äôt hurt at this point.

I think most of the people, myself included, who don‚Äôt see results with the in-office procedure the first time DO see results with the second. So I think it has more to do with the amount of Botox being administered. I think the GA procedure has a larger dose to begin with. The in-office dose might need some tweaking. 

That said, for the in-office procedure, the first dose is ¬£850 but if it doesn‚Äôt work you just pay the ¬£250 for the second dose. So ¬£1100 total. I think if you go in with that figure in mind and the assumption you may need 2 doses it‚Äôs better than assuming it will all work after the first injection. 

With my first I thought it had done nothing but my notes from my second mentioned the muscle being harder to find BECAUSE it was partially paralysed by the Botox (which is what it‚Äôs supposed to do). 

Anyway the procedure is pretty straightforward. Lie down, have some electrodes stuck to you, needle inserted and adjusted, you‚Äôre asked to swallow and sniff to make sure it‚Äôs in the right place. And it‚Äôs done. About 30 mins including consultation for the first one. My second round was also 30 mins, but there was almost no consultation and the time was spent trying to locate the muscle, and also she does an injection on each side for round 2. 

I think the in-office procedure is great, it just needs a little tweaking with possibly a higher initial dose but for a condition that‚Äôs only been treated for 3 years or so I‚Äôm impressed with it.

I‚Äôm in the same boat. After my second injection I had about 2 months of burps and then they were gone. 

My aesthetician thought maybe I am resistant to Botox? So I‚Äôve thought of maybe getting a few injections in my face to see if 1) it goes away quicker than expected and 2) if I can make my body see it‚Äôs not a threat and maybe it would work again. 

The funny thing about it all is that I was a patient of the ophthalmologist who first started using Botox for cosmetic reasons rather than just to freeze the nerves around the eyes, and here I am apparently immune to it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But I was talking to someone who works in aesthetics about it not working and how I have an autoimmune condition and we were wondering if my immune system is just killing the Botox too soon? So I‚Äôm considering getting a bit of Botox in my face to 1) be able to directly see how quickly it is absorbed by my body and 2) to see if I can build some resistance. After all, Botox is a toxin and if my body sees gluten and thinks it‚Äôs a threat, it seems logical that it would also see and attack literally poison.

If you‚Äôve met your deductible, insurance usually covers all of it except for the Botox, since it is an experimental drug. The cost of the Botox is $600. I guess some insurance may not cover it because there‚Äôs not much research or literature published on the condition, but Dr. Bastian said they just published their research and it was approved, so the condition should be more well-known soon!

Title    : How long until burping?
Selftext :
To those who have had the Botox procedure done, when did the microburps start? It has been about 36 hours since my procedure and I can feel something different in my throat. Swallowing is getting a little harder and the gurgles are different. I‚Äôve tried turning my head in every direction and doing every motion to try and burp, but nothing yet. It feels so close! How long will it take for me to burp?

Title    : Got procedure, GI doc wouldn‚Äôt believe it
Selftext :
I got the Botox procedure back in March. My dad is a doctor and works at the hospital with my gastroenterologist. My dad was telling this other doctor (an older man) about the procedure and the wonders it did for me and offered to send him Dr. Bastian‚Äôs research to look over.  

The GI doc bluntly said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. My dad is a very intelligent and well respected doctor. He is also older but is always open to new research. It frustrates me so much that some doctors are so stubborn and refuse to believe that a condition exists that they don‚Äôt know about. Sorry. Rant over!

Thank you for the reply! Maybe I can look at really gross things and induce a gag that way. I usually do something similar and open a drink and leave it in the fridge until it's less fizzy. My friends all think it's gross but I just remind them every time they burp to think about what it would feel like if they couldn't. People will never understand our struggle haha.

Title    : Is anyone else interested in a survey of this subreddit?
Selftext :
I think it would be really interesting to do an overall survey of fellow no-burpers to see what kind of correlations there are amongst this group. How many exhibit certain symptoms? Are there dietary considerations? Does it relate to demographics?

I would be happy to set up this survey and analyze the data, if there is an interest in it.

**Final EDIT: Closed again**

**EDIT: Due to a bunch of requests from those who missed the window, the survey will be reopened for THIS WEEKEND ONLY. Link [here](https://goo.gl/forms/yOZooLntUo9BZ3qZ2). It will be closed for good Monday morning.**  
***  
Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to the survey! I am no longer accepting new responses 

The replies have been trailing off, so I decided to close the survey at a whopping **774 responses**. This got a lot more attention that I had expected, with previous subreddit surveys ([2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/4ao8us/i_visualized_uhdawgggy_and_ufooby420s_survey_data/) and [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/3b2pd6/preliminary_survey_results_feedback_appreciated/)) coming in with around 200 responses each. However, likely due to the influx from AskReddit about a month ago, it seems that it was the perfect time to do a new and improved version. 

There's a lot of data, I just spent several hours doing a first pass through it. It's going to take a while to get it all interpreted in a meaningful way, so I may break it down into sections (probably those from the survey), and release it piece by piece. So hold on to your gurgles, everyone. It's coming soon.

Title    : 2019 /r/NoBurp Survey Results
Selftext :
## Introduction

I would like to start this post by reminding everyone that **I AM NOT A DOCTOR**. Information that you get online does **NOT** replace seeing a general practitioner, and that you should always take things your read online with caution. You are responsible for your own safety. If I told you that jumping off a cliff would help you burp, would you do it? I should hope not. That being said, I hope the advice I offer here is slightly more useful than that. 

Thank everyone again for their patience while I took forever to get these results out. My life got unexpectedly crazy busy (maybe taking an unpaid internship on top of a full time job was not my smartest move), so it took me a lot longer to get through these results than I had originally intended. Also, some very interesting things happened that are relevant to this survey and /r/NoBurp, which I'll go into more detail about at the end of this post. 

The data analysis done on the survey responses is basic. There was a total of 789 unique responses to the survey, which is far more than I had ever anticipated. I want to thank everyone who participated in this, we all own this survey and its success. 

Here are the initial assumptions that I made when going through the survey responses: 

* I eliminated any duplicate entries (4)

* Answers clearly avoiding the question were rendered null. Examples: Country: Not America. Weight: 0.0. Note that only that question was rendered null. The rest of the questionnaire was considered to have been answered in good faith

* Any combination of multiple races entered were interpreted as "mixed race"

The fuzziest demographic data was weight because it was not always clear which unit was used. This is my fault for not specifying in the question. The data was interpreted with the following assumptions: 

* anything in the single digit or < 20 range is stone

* anything in the double digit range is kilo

* anything in the triple digit range is lbs

## Demographics:

## Symptoms: 

Here is the [list of most common symptoms suffered by those who identify as "non-burpers"](https://imgur.com/apoQ1A1). Here are the [most common dietary triggers](https://imgur.com/1Kn60FW). And [37% of non-burpers who have been pregnant said that pregnancy did affect their BRD symptoms](https://imgur.com/7ojS29N), which makes sense. 

## Treatment

Unfortunately, very few people have had their concerns about BRD taken seriously by a general practitioner. [Here are the answers to the general questions about treatment (both self and professional](https://imgur.com/G8AVKFQ). 

Teaching yourself to burp:

There was a variety of answers to how some people have taught themselves to burp. I‚Äôve simplified the list of suggestions down to the following: 

* Drinking soda. Force burbs

* Be relaxed (lying down, no constrictive clothing) and keep your esophagus straight and open

* Do ‚Äúexercises‚Äù that will work your throat muscles. This might feel like ‚Äúforcing‚Äù a croak up your throat, ensuring your throat is relaxed, 

* Messing with your gag reflex (I‚Äôm not sure what this means, but several people mentioned it)

* Gagging or coughing

* Deep breaths (followed by working your abdominal/throat muscles, sort of like vomiting)

* Massaging throat or pressing down on throat when you feel the need to burp

* Some people suggested that "vomiting air" in the bathroom eventually lead to being able to burp

This is my favourite funny suggestion in two iterations (please don‚Äôt do this to yourself)

* I punched myself in the throat to release the tense muscle. Over time I no longer needed to hit my throat.

* One drunken night I tried a sort of karate chop on my throat that kind of worked

Other self-treatment suggestions to relieve gas mostly tend to refer to ‚Äúair puking‚Äù. Here are a few other suggestions that were made:

* Doing some star jumps or a quick jog can sometimes dislodge some gas

* Lying down flat on back

* Hot showers 

* Holding my breath to get rid of the hiccups

* In order to release all of the gas, I‚Äôll do a handstand on the wall and be able to release most flatulence.

* Sucking in my stomach can cause a gurgle, which gradually relieves the pressure

* Mint tea 

* Fennel seeds

* Eating probiotics

* Crystallized ginger

* Salty snacks like pretzels help reduce effects of bloating.

* Fish oil supplements

* GasX (most commonly reccommended drug), Simethicone, Tums/Antacids, Ranitidine, Dramammine

* Taking an activated charcoal to reduce gas 

* Rubbing my stomach 

* Avoiding aggressors like carbonated drinks

* Fasting

* No-carb diet

* Eating smaller and more frequent meals throughout the day. 

* Eating slowly

* Hot compresses. 

Again, here is a funny reply. ‚ÄúMaking myself gay usually does the trick.‚Äú I truly suspect they meant ‚Äúgag‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgay‚Äù but I still laughed at the idea that making yourself gay could help you start burping. 

## Botox Treatment
There are few enough responses (10) to this that I am just going to [post the entire responses](https://imgur.com/SiPd3lA) for people to look through.

## Comments

* If this survey is done again, have more detailed questions about farting

* Sticky post compiling burping exercises or methods for alleviating pain would be a good idea for the sub. BRD is just a pain.

* A flair for posts with exercises/treatments (as opposed to questions) would be helpful

* Have a pamphlet/info we can share with our doctor that explains the condition so that they can look into it more. 

Some really great comments as responses to ‚ÄúAnd to end on a more positive question, are there any upsides to being a non-burper?‚Äù

* noburp my homies I love you 

* really glad to have found my people 

* I hope to meet one of you irl, we are such rare unicorns.

* "to find other people who suffer and take it seriously. Even my family didn‚Äôt take it seriously until pretty recently. I‚Äôve started being really open and honest about it with people to lesson the embarrassment. "

* Kids think gurgles sound like a velociraptor 

* being part of a small group of elite humans 

* Dragon/Demon burps are almost a fun party trick! XD

* I have legendary farts.

* People think my little hiccups are cute, they call them "cheeps" and I've been told they're adorable. 

* I don't have to taste burps (it seems like they usually taste bad).

* I have probably unintentionally broken some farting world records

* Not really. My girlfriend burps like a demon. I wish I could answer her burp calls. 

## Conclusion
I love how y‚Äôall describe the weird sounds that your throats make. Demons screaming, velociraptors, cheeps. It's so good. 

Some of the comments about how BRD affects your life are...hard to read frankly. People here talk about it ruining their lives, how they feel unrecognized and unhelped. I want to let everyone know that you are not alone!

First of all, if you are ever thinking about harming yourself, please don't do it! There are resources out there that can help you, and that is something you can never take back. Please go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicideprevention/comments/6hjba7/info_suicide_prevention_hotlines/) for more resources for help if you need it. 

Secondly, I coming bearing good news! Not long after I posted the survey here, I was contacted by a real life medical doctor who has a patient that also cannot burp. He was searching the internet for literature on this condition and came across /r/NoBurp and this survey. He agrees that it seems like a largely unrecognized medical condition and asked if I would be willing to share the results with him for the purposes of co-writing a paper on the topic! I have been working with him ([Dr. John Rosen](https://twitter.com/johnmrosen)) and a health psychologist, Dr. Christina Low-Kapalu on the results analysis and are preparing a paper to be presented at a national meeting. I'm not sure when that will be published, but I will be sure to update this subreddit when it does!

AND there is more! A journalist from the Guardian reached out to me because she wants to write a feature about this condition and this survey. She also cannot burp, so she feels our pain. That should be coming out pretty soon. 

If anyone wants a link too all the imgur images linked in this post [here](https://imgur.com/a/7QtLMm9) is the whole album. Let me know if you have any questions or comments about the analysis of this survey.

#EDIT: 

I just realized that I forgot to include some of the information about other symptoms, including info about emetophobia, etc. I will update this post with that information as soon as possible.

Hi! I just found this thread for the first time. Sticky posts are not always the best bet because only two can be stickied at any one time, and eventually they can no longer be edited. 

I'm incorporating the information for this post into the subreddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index) where I've been building a list of doctors who perform the procedure. Would you mind if I copy the **No doctors near you?** section into the wiki more or less verbatim? It's helpful and well-written and I think it would be a worthy inclusion.

Not necessarily. I have all of the classic symptoms of this group, but I burped normally as a baby. I still burp once or twice a year; I have been trying to train myself to do it more frequently with some progress. But most of the time I cannot burp and experience all the discomfort that other no-burpers do. Not burping seems to be a symptom, and it's very possible that more than one condition can cause it.

I've found my no burp symptoms have stayed fairly consistent throughout my life, so far (31). Dietary changes did help me to a degree - I now drink very little carbonated drinks (used to drink a lot of beer) and it turned out I was having digestive issues as well. I've always had some food issues (growing lactose intolerance throughout my 20s), but they suddenly got way worse when I turned 30. Doing a elimination diet helped me identify things that were causing excessive bloating (turned out FODMAPs were part of it, but not the whole issue). So making those dietary adjustments reduced the overall amount of bloating and gas I had, even though they didn't fix the no-burp. They can't fix that side of things. 

But I would highly recommend an elimination diet if you think you might be having digestive issues. Worst case, it's not from food and you're no worse off than you are now (and you have more evidence for your doc that R-CPD is the source of the issue). Best case, you identify some things that can help reduce bloating in your GI without needing surgery.

The best way to approach doctor's appointments is to be well prepared with the information they will need. 

1. I have symptoms [X, Y Z. . .]
2. I have had these symptoms for [period of time]
3. These symptoms have the following detrimental effects on my life [give specific examples]
4. Follow up with a call to action  [are there potential medications that can treat this?] [are there treatments for this] [Can I get referred to a specialist] [What are the risks/outcomes associated with different treatments] [I have heard of this specific treatment, can we discuss it] [what are the next steps to doing that?]

I find that I get flustered at doctors appointments and sometimes forget to include everything, or that I don't think I expressed myself well. So I write down the issues I want to address and what I want to get out of it, then I jot down a few quick notes during or after the appointment to remind myself of all of the outcomes. Know what points you want to press (in the case of R-CPD, likely "yes this is a real and significant issue in my life and I want to address it").

Title    : Some Canadian Doctors Have a No-Burp Group Chat!
Selftext :
I've been seeing Dr. Leclerc in Montreal and was talking with her today about scheduling my botox procedure. I mentioned Dr. Hicklin's paper about the awake version of the procedure and my doctor said she would check in with her colleagues about who does it awake/asleep. She said that she has a group chat with them to discuss this condition and its treatment! 

I have no idea who is in this chat or not, but I thought you all might find that as delightful as I do. Nice to know that there is an ongoing dialogue about this treatment. 

It sounds like Dr. Anderson in Toronto does it awake, but everyone who does the procedure in Montreal does it under anesthesia.

Me too! I've always avoided tomatoes and in the last 5 years or so I've cut out every tomato-containing product. 

My R-CPD symptoms got worse with age too, and they were compounded as I developed dietary intolerances. I did an elimination diet last year and have cut out certain FODMAP groups that upset my stomach. It hasn't solved the R-CPD, but it has lessened some of my symptoms.

Can't hurt to keep an eye out for dietary intolerances in general (FODMAP or otherwise). Again, it won't cure R-CPD, but it could help with symptom management if you do happen to have have dietary intolerances as well.

Hello everyone! Wishing everyone no bloating and normal amounts of gas. 

I am a little embarrassed to realize that I am the only remaining active mod on this subreddit. The other mods have not been active on reddit for a while, but this subreddit is more active than ever. As such, I‚Äôd like to put up a call for mods and for suggestions to improve the subreddit. This is the time to make this subreddit yours, and to discuss the direction you want it to take. 

**Call for Mods**

Hello all,

I've been reached out to by a researcher from the George Washington University doing a study on R-CPD (/u/RCPDQuestionnaire). At their request and for the sake of visibility, I am reposting their survey and pinning it to the top of the sub. 

Details:

>Thank you to everyone that helped in our research and feedback for the survey! While we cannot change the content of the questionnaire currently, we will incorporate additional feedback in future iterations of our study!

>We did adjust our demographics so that individuals outside of the US can participate and we would love to hear from you.

>The original post and description of the research study is reposted below:

>Currently, I am on a research team at our institution working in conjunction with the department of Otolaryngology ‚Äì Head and Neck Surgery at The George Washington University attempting to better understand retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction, or RCPD. This condition is also referred to as "no-burp syndrome."

>The objective of the study is to validate a patient questionnaire regarding symptoms of RCPD, in order to develop a diagnostic tool for this condition. Among those who have received treatment for RCPD, we also aim to assess effectiveness of treatment(s) for RCPD.

>Your insight is invaluable, and we would greatly appreciate your time (around 5 minutes) in filling out a short survey regarding your experiences with RCPD.

>Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous. If already submitted, please do not complete the survey more than once!

>Completion of the survey is indication of your consent to participate in this research study.

Title    : Gas-X Experiences? Alcohol/Drinking
Selftext :
Hi everyone! I‚Äôm 21(F) and of course I‚Äôm here because I can‚Äôt burp. :( It has recently become even more of an anxiety-inducing issue because of nights out/drinking. Unfortunately a lot of drinks are carbonated (seltzers, cocktails that have soda in them, etc) which I really have to avoid but it isn‚Äôt always convenient. I get super bloated, gassy, have bad stomach pains, and I have really loud gurgles. One big problem is I don‚Äôt always have the ability to pass the gas since I mainly drink in social situations, and I find it hard to do this discreetly in the bathroom with people nearby. All my own fault I suppose for mainly drinking carbonated drinks, but I know even just alcohol can be a trigger in general. 

So, anyone have any experiences with Gas-X for issues with drinking? If you‚Äôve had positive experiences, do you usually take it right before drinking? Thank you!

Title    : Botox before another surgery?

Hi everyone! So I‚Äôm scheduled for Botox in a few weeks, but I also have another surgery coming up. The other surgery will be almost 2 months after I get the Botox. 

Everything has been cleared with both doctors and they don‚Äôt think it should cause any issues having the surgeries close together at least in terms of the frequency of being under anesthesia. But does anyone have a similar experience? I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a big deal but just curious. I wish I could‚Äôve scheduled the Botox sooner! 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is a dumb question. I‚Äôm just curious in terms of where I‚Äôll be in terms of burping/the effects of the Botox when I get the other surgery. I hope it‚Äôll be easy to keep food down and whatnot after having anesthesia with the second surgery.

I also have Blue Cross Blue Shield (Pennsylvania) insurance and I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôll be covered. I called my insurance with the exact surgery codes but unfortunately they were unsure.

I also snack lightly (simple snacks like peanut butter crackers, a granola bar, etc.) before/during the ride because for me, being on an empty stomach makes me a bit more nauseous. I also think there are like otc motion sickness patches you can buy but I‚Äôve never tried them. I hope you enjoy your trip!

I just did the same.  My hiatal hernia had gotten larger and both the GERD and R-CPD caused esophagel motility problems, so I got the hiatal hernia fixed about a month ago and will be going to Chicago in December for the botox.  I definitely feel different inside after the hernia repair in terms of gas moving around since it can't escape through burps - causing more discomfort.  Hoping after botox my insides can heal completely and get back to normal. Good luck with yours!

Title    : Weird sounds after botox?
Selftext :
This question is for those that have already had Botox (with any doctor).  I just got the Botox last week with Dr. Bastian and the day after I was having microburps.  Now, I am able to release trapped gas, but I would not call it a burp.  It is more a gurgle that comes out - like my UES is still tight, but air is kind of leaking out, slowly, but not in one "pop" like a burp.  Anyone else had this?  I am scared my UES is crazy tight and the botox loosened it up a bit, but it won't last.  Did anyone else have weird gas release that wasn't a burp and burping came later?  Also, feel very "phlegmy" like mucus constantly in the back of my throat.  Actually so much its kind of stuck and changing my voice.  I have a follow up with Dr. Bastian tomorrow, but just thought I'd see who else might have experienced this.  I am so glad to be be able to release gas no matter what weird sound it makes at the moment, as not feeling bloating 100% of the time is amazing.

I never felt like I had trouble swallowing.  Then I had to have manometry done for my hiatal hernia surgery and I failed 100% of the swallow tests and was surprised since I didn't think I had swallowing difficulty.  While waiting for my hernia surgery, I found this forum and scheduled an appt with Dr. Bastian.  He told me that after years of the gas trying to come out and because we can't burp, the esophagus dilates and that causes swallowing issues.  He also said that after botox and the ability to burp, the esophagus is believed to slowly heal and regain its movement and therefore the swallowing difficulties get better.  I guess maybe all of us non-burpers have some level of swallowing issues, only I didn't know it because I've never been able to burp, so I never knew any different since its been messed up since birth.

Unfortunately, I don't think you have any way to tell.  I am almost 4 weeks post Botox and I still do not have control over it.  Sometimes I cough and burp, or laugh and burp or talk and burp.  Anything that might squinch up my stomach causes me to burp, so I'm glad I'm working from home and don't have to be on the phone much.  It is not all the time and maybe you can plan meals around meetings, like don't eat right before hand?  Of course if you have leave built up from not vacationing during the pandemic like a lot of us do, maybe you want to just take off a couple weeks and relax.

Title    : Burps are weird sounding

Anyone post botox and their burps are not really burp sounds?  I'm 6 weeks out now and my burps (according to my husband) are reminiscent of the sound of the zombies in the Walking Dead (I haven't watched the show, but I have heard the show while he's watched and think he's correct unfortunately).  Does the sound of the burp change to something more "normal" as time passes and botox wears off completely or is this what I am now because the current sound  is fine while I'm working from home during the pandemic, but it would definitely be embarassing if I were in the office or around others?

I had the mucus feeling for several week afterwards.  It did go away.  However, my ability to burp is going away and I think I may have to go for a round 2.  Practice as much as you can around the 6 week mark because everything before that are burps because its all open from the botox, but when it starts wearing off, you have to try to learn how to do it.

I don't see any posts related to him, so I just wonder if anyone has had botox with him and the results and if you liked him?  I loved Dr. Bastian, but driving 700 miles again isn't appealing.

Nothing preventing travel in terms of physically getting up and going, as you shouldn't have any issues walking around or tiredness wouldn't really be an issue.  The issue is, is this a vacation and the difficulty swallowing would affect your enjoyment of your vacation?  I had trouble swallowing for like a week at least afterwards and a "mucusy" feeling in my throat for maybe 3 weeks or so which was annoying, but not unbearable.  So, it depends on whether you want to deal with those while on holiday.  Remember too, the burping can be uncontrollable.  The UES is just open after botox, so if I twisted in my seat - burp, if I laughed - burp, cough, burp, you get it.  Totally uncontrollable for like a month.  That being said, the bloating that comes with R-CPD is real too, so you trade off the post botox symptoms (if you wait) for the bloating you still have with R-CPD.  Your choice.  Having gotten botox 10 weeks ago and am now going back for a second round, I honestly have no idea how I lived with the discomfort of R-CPD for 46 years.  Going back to the gurgles is so unpleasant, I have no problem dealing with the trouble swallowing and mucusy feeling again.

I had to kind of "push" my stomach to get burps out at first.  I would kind of suck in the top in the abs to attempt to push air out.  I heard someone else physically pushed on their stomach to force it out.  Do whatever you can to practice, practice, practice.

I have no idea how many units of Botox I got the first time.  It never occurred to me to ask.  Now of course, I'll be asking when I am there this week.  It started to wear off around week 8 for me and burping was getting harder.  I had to contort my neck and jaw into all kinds of positions. I was pushing my stomach and diaphragm so much I was sore trying to get burps out.  I faced the facts and realized I was one of the 1 out of 5 where it doesn't take and scheduled again.  Hoping I'm twice and done this time around and don't have to go the myotomy route.  I am 46 and talk on here says the older you are, the less it might take, so maybe that is it.  However, since Dr. Bastian only named R-CPD in 2019, no one ever knew about it before or what to do about it, so there was no option to try this earlier.  Practice trying to isolate the muscle needed to burp and do the fizzy drinks.  Practice, practice, practice.  I practiced too, but I'm going to do more this round.  Good luck with your healing and practice!

Thank you for this, as you mentioned, I haven't seen many experiences in DC and this is good information.  I just had my second round of botox with Dr. Bastian last week and if it wears off again and I lose the ability to burp, traveling to Chicago is getting cost prohibitive, so I was wondering if Dr. Bielamowicz is good.  Is he personable?  Did you like him?  What tests did he require before the botox?

Probably not what you want to hear, but yes, there is uncontrollable burping which happened for me pretty much the day after.  Laugh -> burp, cough -> burp, twist your torso -> burp.  Anything that might squish up your stomach seemed to push the air up and with a dead UES due to botox, the burps come right out.  I did have some while speaking and was glad to be working from home and not talking to anyone that much.  I'd reschedule one of them if you could as telling people the situation just gets weird.  Telling my bosses what my issues were to get the botox was weird, as it sounds trivial but people don't realize how awful it is and don't understand.

No actual vomiting, just when air comes up to burp, some stomach contents come up with it and you swallow it back down. Sounds gross, but really just happens involuntarily. You'll do great!

I wanted to offer a different perspective as a 49 year old that had the botox at age 47.  Like everyone else, I didn't know other people had this until I found out about R-CPD in 2020.  I thought I was just defective and not much I could do about it.  I also went through a MAJOR flare up with my GERD in 2020 that caused me to finally schedule surgery for hiatal hernia.  As part of the whole trying to fix my digestive tract, I decided to do the botox too.  Just like you, I can't say I felt the effects of lifelong R-CPD.  I didn't have pain and I always had a little extra weight, so I didn't notice any horrible bloating.  After getting the botox, let me telll you this.  YOU EXPERIENCE THE SYMPTOMS - YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT because the bloating is your norm.  That is because you've lived with this all your life.  It is NORMAL for you and you've never been able to burp, so you don't know any different.  Once I could burp, I could then feel the difference.  I used to wonder why on days when I had to go into my office, my pants would always feel really tight on the way home.  I guess I was just basically clueless and unaware, but it was because I was wearing business casual pants with a button to work versus the sweats I wear at home and the pants got tight from bloating increasing throughout the day.  I never understood why my pants were tighter because not burping and bloating were my norm and I honestly didn't know any other way to live.  Once you experience the relief from burping after botox, you'll not be able to believe you lived the way you did for so long.  IT IS SO WORTH IT!  

Not only the comfort aspect, but there are physical reasons for getting the botox.  Dr. Bastian told me the esophagus gets dilated from the air bouncing up and down in the esophagus all the time (the gurgles).  My esophagus doesn't work.  I had manometry for the hiatal hernia surgery and I failed miserably - my esophagus doesn't contract to push the food down.  Dr. Bastian says it is due to R-CPD because the esophagus was stretched for over 40 years and the muscles don't work anymore.  My LES is shot due to the pressure the gas in the stomach put on it for all those years so I am permanently on PPIs to try to avoid constant reflux that might lead to esophageal cancer.  Yes, long-term PPI use may contribute to dementia later in life, but I have to choose between esophageal cancer or PPIs.  If I could have burped all my life like a normal person, my esophagus would probably work and I wouldn't have even had GERD maybe.  I wonder what dysphagia issues I will have in my old age with an esophagus that doesn't work.

Therefore, if you have the opportunity to get the botox, do it.  It is about more than just discomfort - there are long-term complications that result from this condition.

Title    : Im UK based, wondering about cost of treatment
Selftext :
Hi all. I found out about this subreddit a few years ago and I finally properly joined.

I'm wondering if anyone has had success with getting the treatment via the NHS or if not, how much it'll cost to go private. I know covid has put things back a lot but at this point I need to get a plan in place for the treatment. 

I've been living with no burp all my life but the past 2 years have been debilitating to the point where I'm struggling daily. 

I used to manage it better by eating tiny meals and snacks throughout the day and barely eating large meals, never drinking fizzy drinks ect.

But my new job means I can't do that at all anymore and don't get much of a lunch break and it's meant the condition is debilitating now.

Its hit the point where I struggle to breathe properly about half way through my day because of the air, mostly breathing through my chest rather than diaphragm, I barely sleep because of all the discomfort I feel and it's intolerable.

I'm nervous to go to a doctor because anytime I have I have just been waved off and not taken seriously.

I can't even use that trick to trigger the gag reflex to "throw up air" as I've done it too many times and now I straight up can't trigger it at all.

It's having a terrible effect on my daily life now. i can only ever do things in the morning and on an empty stomach as after bloating it becomes difficult to do things like excersise.

So if anyone who's had the treatment could advice I would be extremely thankful

Title    : How long does it take for Botox to kick in?
Selftext :
I had my Botox surgery on Friday afternoon and I've not had any burps yet. I've definitely got the slow swallowing so I was wondering how long it took for y'all to start burping. 

I had surgery with Dr Karagama

Title    : Anyone turned to alternative medicine?
Selftext :
Hi everyone. First, I was so excited to find this community after diving in google's rabbit hole to try and find, once and for all, what is wrong with me. It is such a revelation to finally understand and connect all those symptoms together!

I am curious if any of you guys have tried to treat our problem through alternative medicine, such as  Acupuncture or Shiatsu? It kind of makes sense to me because having a little background in chinese medicine, I know there's a meridian going through the throat and it might be some kind of stagnation that can be manipulated?  I still need to find out if I can take the Botox procedure in my country but to be honest I am a little bit nervous about it.

Hi, can you share more information about your self cure process? 

How long, and at what frequency did you practice the exercise?

Did you have to keep on trying to burp actively and force it out, or did it just started to happen naturally?

"Long drinks" always made me super full and I cannot drink more than one, so I usually go for anything in a low ball and doesn't mix with any juice, only ice and maybe some lemon: whiskey, gin, anis drinks with some water...  this keeps me feeling light. 

I love wine too but unfortunately it's also making me very full after one glass. 

and of course, having alcohol with food always leads to such a torture, especially when socializing and talking with people. I'm so glad to find this community with people who actually understand!

hi there, could you please elaborate on your case? You mean, a misaligenment in the pelvis was connected to your inability to burp? Did you end up getting the bottox, or finally you didn't have to? Could you explain about the connection between the two (pelvis and no-burp), and what kind of treatment the Osteopath gave you?

Title    : Weak voice + local clinic skepticism
Selftext :
Does anyone else here always had weak voice? I'm suspecting it has a connection with my r-cpd.

Today I went to a swallowing clinic to tell them about this syndrome since I couldn't find any information about it in my country's language. The doctor said he has heard about r-cpd but that it is a controversial diagnosis because "it doesn't make sense the issue will just be on one direction (to release air) and not on the other direction (to swallow)". So they sent me to other bunch of examination and I'm not optimistic they will allow me the Botox.

They put me through a swallowing text where they put a camera through the nose to the throat while I need to speak and swallow things (not fun at all!) and only thing they saw was that my  vocal cords are thin and that I need to drink more water (which I cannot do, because of r-cpd it makes me feel like I need to throw up! I drink about 3-4 glasses a day.

very frustrating :(

it somehow makes sense to me that when the body struggles with trapped air in the chest for so many years, it would effect the voice chords as well.

Also I took some Chinese medicine basics and according to it, people who have an issue in their lung energy suffer from weak voice, to the point it can take effort for people to hear you (=me). Again, it makes sense to me that it's all related. As the gurgles often make me over-controlling my breath when I'm in public I feel this can be related.

You are lucky you can do this. I tried air vomiting by sticking my fingers in my mouth and now I tried your way and I just can't do it. 

I do remember one time years ago when it just happened - I felt like I need to throw up and there was a big "roar" that came out of me and I felt like I threw up but then realized only air came out. I thought it was bizarre but felt a relief afterwards. Little did I know...

I wish I could voluntarily do that but I'm wondering if maybe my brain stops me because I am afraid of the feeling of throwing up. It could have been so helpful I imagine :(

(but do you think it brings up acids from the stomach? I wonder if it has bad effects to keep on doing that as a habit).

Title    : insufficient water consuming
Selftext :
I am curious to know how r-cpd effects people here in the term of drinking water. I am drinking something like 3 glasses a day and I am even forcing myself to do THAT. But when I have air in my chest I simply cannot force myself to drink because it just brings me distress and so many gurgles.

I have a habit of forcing myself to drink a whole glass when I wake up and my stomach is empty.  Then I really try to drink more during the day (water or herb drink) but usually I can't do more than 3 total unless I'm reeeeally thirsty.

Obviously this is not a good thing, especially since I live in a hot country. Are you also dealing with this?

Just an anecdote regarding "normal people" which I know you guys would get:

during studies of chinese medicine we went over body pathologies and one of them was borborygmus. The teacher explained that these are strange noises that come from the stomach. So my eyes lightened up and I asked "Does it also include noises that come from the chest and throat??" and the teacher just looked at me strangely and said "no. from the stomach". And I was like "but...but...."

Kept on waiting for this pathology to be mentioned but of course it never was. That was the final push that made me realize what I am experiencing my whole life is NOT normal.

Then again it pushed me into a serious web search which lead me into discovering r-cpd.

Title    : Anyone been through Manometry?
Selftext :
Hi. So the doctor sent me to FEES (that showed nothing is wrong), barium sawllow (same), and the next examinations are Manometry and esophageal ph monitoring.

 I am really terrified from these two but I'm wondering if they are actually the ones I need to take because it may show something is wrong? as it's obvious there is no swallowing issue, but maybe they can actually point out at the trapped air?

Has anyone gone through this and can share the results? 

This doctor did hear of r-cpd but I don't think he will agree to botox before seeing the results (if he agrees at all).

Title    : question for those who cured themselves
Selftext :
So I've been practicing Shaker exercises for the past two weeks and sometimes I feel a sensation I never felt before, like very gentle bubbles in my throat (not the same location as the gurgles and with no noise, but they also don't bring any relief).

Also, when I have the gurgles and I'm trying to turn them into a burp, I sometimes manage to produce some kind of other air manipulation that has a higher pitch than the gurgles, but again, brings no relief.

I'm just wondering is this a good sign? have you experienced something like this on the path to burping?

I think simply discovering r-cpd and this forum helped me a lot even just in being able to connect between all those symptoms and understand why they are caused.

So far I've been practicing the Shaker for 3 weeks, still no results (though I admit I'm a bit lazy at some days) but I plan to keep going.

I started to be more aware of how I eat and drink and trying to minimize air swallowing, it actually really helped in reducing the gurgles. I eat slowly, I'm being careful with soup (and I guess stringy food is the same - makes you swallow more air). Someone in this group said that drinking while raising the glass a bit higher helps and I think it's true.

When the attack comes, like others here mentioned, I'm just lying on my back until it goes away (I think it also helps to be alone so you don't have to speak with anyone and relax your breathing).

Also someone in this forum said he was cured after some treatment with an osteopath and i'm going to try that (well, if it can't hurt).

&#x200B;

if this, and the Shaker won't improve the situation, i'll have to think about how to get the botox treatment, which I doubt I can get in my country.

Good luck, we're all together in this.

That's the thing with r-cpd, because it's not a known thing, I think we were all just assuming everyone are going through same things until a certain age when you start to realize it's only you. I always thought the gurgles is an annoying part of digestion, just like when the stomach makes noises when a person is hungry.

I think it's also because on social events you talk more so swallow more air and maybe eat faster. Also, I noticed that just going outside the house can make it worse because when it is cold and the nose starts to be a little runny, then I breath more from the mouth, whereas at home I usually breath from the nose which leads - I think - to less air being swallowed.

But sure thing eating and drinking on social events lead to anxiety and trying to control breathing which starts that vicious circle :/

I was having these thoughts myself but didn't want to sound too "new age"? But I am also a very tensed person, sensitive and over-thinker. And I experienced quite a few times when my brain worked against my body's natural tendencies in several ways. I did burp as a baby (according to my mother) so I guess I developed RCPD in childhood.

Not sure about fear of vomiting- I didn't vomit much in my life and when I did, I felt it was horrible but I kind of assumed it feels the same for everyone since it's not a natural process.

I have been trying to treat rcpd with an osteopath and he told me that many times, issues that have to do with breathing and digesting originate in psychological conditions (repressed traumas, distress, tension etc).

This is just another thing to consider and I'm sure there are several reasons that can cause the physical condition of rcpd. But I believe very much in the effect of our emotional state on the function of our body. \*Don't get me wrong, I don't think that relaxing/meditating/going to therapy or whatever will cure the situation after the bad mechanism already exists. But I also don't discard the possibility that it can be created by an emotional state.

Sadly though, it doesn't really go out (or just a very meaningless amount) and I still get no relief and gurgles continue. I can somehow manipulate them to reach that point in my throat, but it feels like there's not enough amplitude to really push the air outside?

Title    : New unfamiliar pain while breathing
Selftext :
So few days ago before going out I decided to try and take a gaz-x pill because I read someone here said it relieves the gurgles and other air issues.

Now I don't know if it's related but about an hour later I started to feel pain right behind my thorax on the left side which is getting worse while trying to take a deep breath. It's located right under the breast, inside. This is a new pain for me - during RCPD symptoms I can feel bloated in my chest but it's more up and in the middle.

I thought maybe somehow the air slipped to the wrong direction and assumed it will go away but it's been 3 days and it still doesn't pass! I am now avoiding taking deep breaths.

trying to google the pain, I came across the term  **Pneumothorax** which  occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. Some of the triggers were pressure on the lung, or: " Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst ‚Äî allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs. "

Now i'm a bit scared either my RCPD or those pills have caused this situation..? Was this ever discussed here? I know I may just scare myself by "google diagnosing" :(  I made an appointment to the doctor so let's see what he says.

I have a botox surgery on July so really hope nothing has happened that can influence that...

BTW: the pill really did help with the gurgles. I drank two and a half glasses of whiskey that night with no bad effects. But I prefer the gurgles and the temporary bloating over this new pain that doesn't go away.

Edit: finally after about a week the pain slowly faded away. the x-ray was fine and the doctor said he doesn't know what it was but he thinks either it was gas trapped somewhere, or muscle pain (thought I don't exercise, but maybe it was a reaction to the pill).

I am one week past. I do feel the same about the constant feeling of phlegm but I think that this is just a sensation because I don't actually have more phlegm than before. It's the same sensation when eating and the swallowing is slow and the food lingers in the throat - like your throat is touching something that shouldn't be there which you want to either spit, or swallow.

I was also burping with every movement and small pressure and much like you, in the first days I didn't enjoy it at all because it tasted bad and just felt like everything is out of control. And yes I also feel more bloated than usual, like i'm always on the verge of burping - from reading people's comments here I understand I might also be taking in more air than before.

The doctor said my esophagus was wider than usual because of all the years of trapped air, so she expected i'd have a reflux for a while. 

But in the last couple of days it started to be much better and more controllable. if I feel I have air in the esophagus I simply find a place where I can let it out by burping and then i'm fine. I even came back to work. So I can say this is really getting better for me and I hope it will last. It's great that now I can release the pressure. Hope it improves for you quickly!

I had about the same thing. my injection was on July 18th and on August 1st I started a new job in an open space office with a lot of people and socializing so I was really scared.

I think you should try to take something like minimum 3 days off, if not more, or at least ask to work from home in the first few days. The throat felt a bit soar for me in the first 2/3 days and my voice was very weak. swallowing food is also difficult so eating with colleagues might not feel comfortable.

Unfortunately I could only take 2 days off so I had to deal with it. I did tell people at work what I've been through and that made things easier. People here said to avoid food before meetings but for me - drinking is also a trigger (coffee and even water). Funny enough, the uncontrollable burps might happen after drinking and turning your head to the person sitting next to you. Or talking loudly which requires more air - so try to avoid that (if you want to turn to the person next to you, turn the whole chair, not just the head). Another advice: if you feel the air builds up, go to the bathroom and let it out controllably, then less chances it will happen when you don't want it to.

bottom line: if you can work from home for a while and have time to learn how your body reacts that would be the best. But in any case, tell the colleagues in your team about the operation and that would be one stone raised from your heart :)  (Plus you will educate more people about R-cpd which is always good).

Title    : 3 months post Botox, i'm losing it :(
Selftext :
Tomorrow will be exactly 3 months since my OP (90ml). I went from burping uncontrollably (1st month) to happily burping and free from R-CPD symptoms (2nd month) to feeling a gradual drop and at this point I am really struggling to burp. a lot of times I fail, and when I finally succeed, they are very small and not really relieving. Gurgling is back, bloating is back, etc :( It's so frustrating not to be part of the 80%. Or maybe this statistic has changed by now?

Did anyone have the same experience and was cured after the second time? I'd be happy to hear from people who are over 3 months since their 2nd shot, cured or not.

Thanks.

\*\*Edit: OMG... I read all the replies here and checked out the larynx lowering exercises, and combining with the yoga ball chin squeez exercise, I kinda understood the movement I should be looking for. Then I practiced on it while holding my arms up and stretching my chin forward as some members suggested, and... it worked!! well, a lot of failed attempts but some really good ones too. It actually felt even better than the botox burps? I am definitely going to practice some more. It gives me hope. God bless this forum, i'm so happy I found you people!

I think that none of us realized how abnormal this "being full" feeling is until we discovered r-cpd and the connection with not being able to burp. It did seem weird to me to get full so quickly and even after drinking coffee but I just assumed I have a small stomach or some bad digestion. There's a spectrum to r-cpd: some feel really sick after each meal but some only sometimes get to this level. 

Try to diagnose yourself from Dr. Bastian's video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ryeCv0\_qi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ryeCv0_qi8)

If you 1) Can't burp 2) Have gurgling noises from your throat/chest 3)feeling bloating/pressure on your chest/neck/abdomen 4)excessive flatulence - You may have r-cpd.

I think a lot of doctors would not be aware of this so you might need to look for one from the list in this sub. But of course, always good to take tests that eliminate other issues.

Hi there. i'm 4.5 months after botox. At first it was very easy and even uncontrollably, just by turning my head or even speaking a bit loud. then as the botox slowly wore off I only burped by turning my head to the side, but after 3 months, that didn't work too. Actually nothing worked anymore, but then I started to practice on lowering my larynx (you will find ways n Youtube) and once I understood the hang of it, this is still the only thing that works for me, combining it with holding two hands and stretching them up. 

At first it worked like a charm and I was amazed to get the control back, but as this, too, is becoming more difficult and rare, I am going to have another procedure. Still, I am really happy to learn this technique because it seems like a good way for practicing that muscle (fact is, it's working even after botox wore off, as opposed to the other "easy", more passive techniques like head turning). I really hope that now when I know it, it will help me practice better during the second time and hopefully keep the ability. Good luck!

I know what you mean! Recording vocals in a studio with a condenser microphone while struggling  with the gurgles at the same time...urgh. It's a shame I always like to drink whiskey while recording. 

The first 2 or 3 days after the op I could barely talk, I think it's because of the tube they put in your throat. during the first month the burps were uncontrollable (I got 90cc) so don't schedule anything :) I did feel even after 2 or 3 months that I cannot reach some frequencies, but I think that was happening while the botox was still in effect. But it's improving and I think it takes a bit of time but it does get back to normal.

&#x200B;

Today, I'm 6 months after. I can sing as before, but sadly, I'm also RCPD'ed as before. When the botox wore off, all the symptoms came back and I can no longer burp at all. I have my second round on March.

Thanks for the information.

What I plan to do on the 2nd round is 1)Practice more on how to let them out without turning the head to the side (which is the more easy but passive method, I feel). the previous time I managed to do that by larynx lowering exercises, but I feel that I started too late, in the end of month 3.

2) Shaker exercises - well I always say that but I hope that this time I'll manage to be motivated enough to actually keep doing them. 

I wonder if anyone here has actually been through a muscle cut procedure? It's really scary.

Title    : Could we actually swallow / produce more air than "normal" people? Some thoughts after 2nd botox
Selftext :
Hi. I am 5.5 months after my 2nd botox. First time (90cc) the effect was gone after 3 months. This time (130cc) I can still burp but it doesn't come naturally. I still need to force them with some effort and maneuvers and it doesn't work every time. (Still, this is so much better than pre botox because I can still reach a relieve most of the time, especially when I'm not around other people).

My thought is perhaps a bit weird, but I'm starting to think that people with RCPD may somehow not only having a problem releasing the air, but we also swallow more air than normal people. I didn't have a way to measure it pre botox, but now I realize I need to release so much air after drinking a glass of water/juice/coffee/wine etc (where before I would have the gurgles). I keep asking my friends if it's the same for them too because I never notice them burping so much, and they say no.  

   
Same after food. in the first months after botox I was not bloated at all because I was constantly burping. But as it is starting to come with more effort I am getting bloated and I suffer for about an hour after every meal, regardless of what I'm eating (and I don't eat a lot, I get full very quickly, and I eat slowly). During this time I am constantly trying to burp (sometimes managing to have a series of small burps) and I'm feeling distress.  
My friends don't experience it at all. They burp occasionally, but they don't feel the need as much as I do. I barely even see them doing those small, silent releases of air.

Another thing that made me suspicious is that some people have mentioned that when I drink, my swallowing is relatively noisy. Even if I am conscious of taking small sips and trying not to swallow air.

Just some thoughts I've been having. Sometimes I feel I just want to avoid eating at all :(

I got a second shot with a higher dose and this time it's been almost 6 months and I'm still able to kind of burp, even if these are strange burps and they don't always come easy. Also they don't come out naturally, I have to kind of force them out.

But hey, I'm still happy if it stays like that, totally better than nothing :) Don't panic, it's natural that after 3 months it will not come so easy anymore like we got used to. The body is still learning something new that it wasn't able to do all these years.

Title    : 6 months after second operation
Selftext :
I thought I'd share my status with you guys.  
First time (90CC) it worked well but wore off after 3 months with not being able to burp at all.  
Second time (130 CC) - paradise for 3 months and then a graduate decline which made me very sad and planning number 3.  But!

The thing is, even after 4, 5 months, I was \*still\* able to burp. It was not as easy, it didn't work all the time, but occasionally it was still satisfying and I could still turn most of the gurgles into burps.  
I still had some panic moments where I felt like my throat is closing again and it's like the air is bumping into a ceiling, and my stomach gets swollen again, but I was encouraged by the fact that if the botox is wearing off and I can still burp, maybe it's my body doing it this time?  


Now it's been a bit more than 6 months and I can still burp sometimes. I have to say it's not exactly "normal" burps and I still have to turn my head to the side, "squeeze" my chest and make funny gestures, but it's definitely satisfying and prevents gurgles. 

I find that it's much easier for me when I'm alone. Then I do it without thinking about doing it.  
When I'm with people, sometimes I would go to the bathroom to do it and sometimes they don't come out at all and then I'm getting nervous. But as long as I have the ability to do it, I am hopeful that my body is learning.

So to conclude - don't lose hope when things don't come easy anymore after 3 months. There will be a decline that you should be expecting (especially if it didn't work out the 1st time). But crossing my fingers that the body is learning and will do it more and more naturally.

If not - I hope the 3rd one will nail it :)

Selftext :
Just thought to stop by again as this forum changed my life and I wanted to give others a message of hope:  
Even if it doesn't last for the first time, don't be discouraged. I raised the quantity from 90 to 130 units and a year after it's pretty safe to say that it was a success.

One important thing is not to panic when the botox wears off and burping starts to take more and more effort. You need to practice on how to do it independently, and it gets easier with time.

My tip is: Don't just think about the throat. As you try to "open" the gate, simultaneously think about actively squeezing the air out from your chest. These two actions together make it work for me.

Mmm I'll try to describe. First - a lot of people here recommended practicing with videos that teach you to lower your voice (there are videos on youtube, I think it's mainly for singers.) - watch them if you still haven't.

So, I still need to turn my head to the right. Then I do this larynx lowering technique (at this point I don't need to actually produce any vocal sound anymore) and I feel it is opening the door to my stomach because at this point I can sort of taste the food I've eaten.   
I imagen there's a tube from my stomach through the chest to my mouth, and in my mind I try to push up the air in my chest up that tube. It's a gentle squeeze back and up. Hard to explain but somehow trying to imagine it is making it work.  
So rather than passively waiting for the air to come out (easy with the botox in effect), I am teaching my body to actively pushing it out, 

Good luck!!

Title    : I'm amazed this subreddit exists
Selftext :
I've lived with the inability to burp for 19 years, I've been in and out of GP offices most of my life with symptoms of extreme pains, nausea etc to which I got ignored because they couldn't find anything in any tests. I've asked about my condition to every doctor in my GP office and they either just ignore me (Probably due to confusion) or laugh at me not taking it serious. Today I was discussing the condition with my partner because (even after 2 years) she's still in disbelief and she suggested I google it to see if anyone else suffers with this problem. Not many results were useful but I then found an article about a man that had the BOTOX injections because of this problem which made me realise that it's not just me. After some contemplation I decided to do an AMA on reddit about not being able to burp and thanks to a fellow user he told me about this subreddit! I'm in disbelief that there is an entire community to discuss issues and help eachother. A big thank you to U/Heidijc for telling me about this subreddit.

Honestly speaking as someone that didn't link This condition and feeling unwell/ in pain a lot of the time I started getting anxiety. I spent 2 years in the house only leaving it on few occasions, try not to let it get into your mind that it's going to happen and if you can't then try and get treatment. The worst thing you can do is let it give you anxiety about things like this because then the anxiety just feeds off it eventually linking going outside to panic, your body will start essentially trying to stop you from going outside because every time you do you're unwell/in pain and eventually results in severe panic attacks and then because they make you feel useless the depression will get worse. Next time you're out and getting symptoms try sucking on some form of mint, I don't know why but mints always seem to help subdue the symptoms for me (even if it only helps a little it's better than nothing).

Thank you for the reply, I actually went to the GP today with news articles, medical reports and even showed him this subreddit briefly so he could get an understanding of how many people this affects and that it is real. He proceeded to tell me he's never heard off it (Not taking me serious) and that he needs to do other tests to rule out any common conditions (even though no common condition causes you to never burp in your life). I will book another appointment with the specialists information etc and hope it gets sorted because trying to get ¬£600 just for an appointment is nearly impossible working for ¬£5.90 an hour.

Is your anxiety caused by your condition or do you get similar symptoms to a panic attack which in turn causes a panic attack? I got diagnosed with anxiety (which now I believe was just because of this condition) and because I thought it was anxiety when I was out and the symptoms occurred I started having more frequent panic attacks, this in turn lead to me eventually not being able to leave the house and until recently recovering slowly; I spent 2 years only leaving the house on rare occasions. I feel like if they just took me serious in the first place then I wouldn't have thought that I had severe anxiety and it would not have progressed to the extent that it did.

However I haven't burped at all, I usually just throw up when it gets too bad (which I guess is burping because air comes up too haha). I've just started a new job as I'm getting back on my feet but I'm still struggling to get myself into work because of the symptoms and the anxiety that comes with it. I hope everything goes well after the surgery and you get back on your feet again! Until then it's worth enquiring about PIP payment to help with bills etc. Good luck!

I'm assuming the symptoms I described at the time were similar, he said "it's very rare for a person your age to have bowl cancer but it's looking like a very high possibility" I was supposed to go for the camera but they never followed up on that either.

I have a phobia of being sick so honestly I just try keep it down as long as possible, i never make myself do it if rather suffer the pain and nausea.

And I started working as a delivery driver, as long as you go the speed limit and get there on time you basically just work on your own at your own pace, that way the contact with people is minimal and I get to do what I want in the car and listen to my own music. I'd suggest looking into delivery as a part-time opportunity if I was you.

Title    : Botox Diary (21/10/2024)
Selftext :
I'm going to preface the diary by saying I'm also emetophobic, diagnosed tourettes, on waiting list for (autism & ADHD), agoraphobic, and diagnosed OCD.

While most of the above is not relevant to anything, it might make people in the same boat with other diagnoses more comfortable to ask questions.

21.10.2024:
I had the in office procedure at 9:30am. The needle isn't bad going in or getting into position. However, injecting the botox felt like a golf ball was inflated in my throat. The rest of the day was fine with sharp pains every now and then that didn't last long.

22.10.2024:
Nothing much happened. I was super gurgly throughout the day and there was a lump of what feels like phlegm sitting in my throat. No pain or anything though.

23.10.2024:
Clearly during my trip I've caught a bug or illness. The lump in my throat was making it super hard to swallow but also making it so I had to swallow A LOT. On top of this I've got a cough and fever (assuming unrelated and I caught something). Breathing was a bit difficult at times because of thr amount of air I was swallowing. However, right near the end of the night I let out a tiny bit of air. (Sleeping would have been impossible without meds due to the uncomfortableness of the symptoms)

24.10.2024
Woke up during the night, still with a high fever. I haven't vomited yet, touch wood, but lots of air is escaping at random points. Currently the lump in my throat isn't too bad so hopefully the fever drops soon so I can have something to eat.

I'm now on day 6 and yesterday was a little easier. Can you explain what burps feel like?

I can now make a lot of noise when I move my neck and/or breath in but it doesn't feel like anything is coming out and I can't taste anything.

Time     : 2024-11-07 05:37:42
body :
Approximately 2-3 days after my last update, I had my first few burps where I could taste it and everything.

Since then, primarily back to the loud noises with no feeling, taste, or relief.

My slow swallow became much more manageable yesterday out of the blue (06/11/2024) but I still can't really eat well because I'm getting much more bloated than pre-botox and can't get any of it out.

I've had some burps after food, which are terrifying, and mini-panic attacks occur pretty much every time due to the feeling and taste, but none have been releaving.  

I'm still holding out some hope and trying to push through the anxiety to ensure I'm not blocking the burps, but it's tough. Hopefully, I'll get the hang of it over the few months before the botox fully runs out. 

Good luck, and hopefully, you'll get some big, releaving burps soon.

Title    : Burp sound but not burping
Selftext :
I had my the botox a few weeks ago and after all the misery it brought, I only had a couple of burps (like under 10) where I could feel air escaping with taste/smell.

However, for the most part if I turn my head to the side or do a sharp inhale my throat makes a really loud, sometimes long, noise (apparently it sounds like a burp to my Wife) but that's it. I don't feel air escaping, it doesn't help my bloating, it doesn't taste or smell. At most I feel a slight vibrating in the throat muscle. 

Anyone else had this? I'm assuming I'm correct in thinking it's not burping.

(I've already booked in for the second botox)

body :
Pretty much back to square one. I still get more of the supragastric burps (i think that's what they are), but they're not helpful at all. I also used to drink fizzy drinks before the botox and accept the consequences because I was used to it. Now I can't really drink anything fizzy after weeks without it.

As much as I'm not looking forward to the first week or two of the side effects again, I have booked in for a second round of the botox in hopes that this one sticks. Hopefully, I will get some relief this time because knowing I'm having a second go at all the downsides, when I didn't experience any upsides, is difficult. 

It also helps that I figured out how to actually eat (swallowing with liquid, not as a chaser) so hopefully i wont lose as much weight this time.

Title    : Anyone else get a lot of anxiety around clothing? did botox change how clothes fit?
Selftext :
Lately I‚Äôve been breaking down most of the times that I have to go somewhere. Because I know my clothing will be too tight later in the day or i‚Äôll be uncomfortable or my bloating may be visible to people. Lately the R-CPD has been worse than ever and I don‚Äôt know how to make getting through the day more bearable. I have a vacation coming up and all I am doing is worrying about what clothes I‚Äôll be able to wear and how uncomfortable I‚Äôll be. 

It‚Äôs to the point where I barely leave the house due to bloating, pain, discomfort, and anxiety around clothing. I feel little gurgles when I feel the worst so I‚Äôm nearly confident botox would change my life. It‚Äôs depressing to think that this is my quality of life for the foreseeable future. 

Did clothing issues get better after botox for anyone who did it? I am counting down the days until I get insurance and I‚Äôm going to book my procedure as soon as humanly possible.

I usually get super uncomfortable and constipated on flights of any length. unfortunately, I have a 17 hour flight coming up. I am SO determined to not let this horrible condition ruin another vacation for me especially since my symptoms have been worse than ever lately. 
my plan:
- eat nothing one (maybe 2?) day before the flight 
- fast the entire flight except for maybe the last hour or two
- limit water drinking the day before and day of the flight
- eat gas x like crazy 
- try to slouch in plane seat to be able to fart

I think it‚Äôs a combination of the sitting position and the gas expanding which plugs everything up in the digestive system. It typically takes 1-3 weeks after a flight for my stomach/bloating/constipation/pain to go back to normal. 4 hours is a short flight so it probably wouldn‚Äôt be that bad.

go to dr bastian and get the botox if he will do it for her. truly you‚Äôd be saving so much money and suffering down the road. I‚Äôm 23 but I had eating disorders, anxiety, and depression that would definitely have been nonexistent or at least a lot better had i not had R CPD as a kid. I can‚Äôt explain how severe it is to have a chest full of air at all times and a huge bloated belly no matter how underweight. i‚Äôm not kidding you how much suffering it caused me as a kid. get your kid treated!!

i think for a lot of us there is no clear pattern. for example sometimes plain white rice is fine for me but other times it makes my stomach hurt. avoid alcohol and fizzy drinks! soups can be pretty bad due to the amount of liquid and sipping may cause more air swallowing.

my pops actually did turn into micro burps over time and I think if I continue to relax my throat every day I‚Äôd eventually be able to burp but to be honest I don‚Äôt feel like waiting so long so I‚Äôm going to get the botox!

Symptoms have just gotten worse and worse. I don‚Äôt do any of the things I used to like to do. I don‚Äôt see friends because I need to lay down after every meal. I don‚Äôt go out at night - I end up in too much pain. I went to dinner the other night and by the end I was in so much pain and had so much bloating I wished I never went. None of my pants fit me by the end of the day. I am now nauseous 90% of the time.

And the worst thing is she specializes in GI issues, shes heard of the disorder, and then tells me that she‚Äôs seen countless patients that can‚Äôt burp and it‚Äôs not really a problem, and just a marketing scheme.

I agree that in some cases, Botox is not necessary, but come on, Anxiety? She thinks that because of my severe emetophobia, I have somehow just turned off of my burping function. I‚Äôm sorry what? 

She tells me to relax and I will be able to burp again. Maybe it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ ive tried that and it doesn‚Äôt work? Maybe it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in chronic pain and that‚Äôs why I came to see her in the first place? Maybe it‚Äôs like I have every single symptom in the book of this condition?

Title    : I might be getting Botox soon I have some questions for the fellow emetophobics
Selftext :
So, I just got scheduled with an ENT that specializes in noburp. I have a consult soon. This would change my life, but I‚Äôm still so scared.

So I have some questions for the post-Botox fellow emetophobics/those who used to have emetophobia.

1. Did your emetophobia improve after Botox? Was it worse? Did it stay the same?

2. Is it really easy to throw up now? That‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm really scared of.

3. Every real burp I‚Äôve had so far (which is like maybe 4 in the past 2 years) tasted like vomit, and gave me panic attacks. Do they still taste like vomit?

4. Apparently there‚Äôs supposed to be regurgitation after Botox? What is that like? Is it actually throwing up?

6. If you have thrown up, is it painful still, or not so painful anymore?

7. Does the nausea somewhat subside? A lot of the constant worry is from being nauseous. 

That‚Äôs all I can think of for now. I would really appreciate any answers. I know this would solve a lot of my pain, but Im still so terrified.

I used to fart so often, every 2 minutes, literally. Always had one loaded. My biggest surprise is that just a week after the Botox, all that‚Äôs gone. 2 months since the Botox? You can barely even remember what it used to be like. I fart maybe 8 times a day now? I remember when I was 6 I heard the average person farts about 14 times a day, and over half of them were in their sleep. I didn‚Äôt believe that. I believed I was just above average. So I decided to count every time I farted the next day. The total by the time I went to bed (not counting the ones IN bed) was 381. I thought I was just special. That it was a little quirk. How wrong I was. 

But now It‚Äôs completely different. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I farted today. I used to be asked that by my brother all the time and the answer was always between 1-7 minutes ago. But I can‚Äôt even remember the last time today!

I remember seeing people in books and movies complaining about how they had to fart in school or public formal places. I was appalled. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that most people didn‚Äôt have to fart- at least once every 20 minutes! I was always like ‚Äújust slip it out silently! No one will notice!‚Äù 
It had never occurred to me that not everyone had to learn how to effortlessly and soundlessly slip one out while they were in class‚Ä¶ at church‚Ä¶ at a wedding or a funeral.

Crazy. It‚Äôs all gone now. My body feels.. empty. It‚Äôs not full of air anymore. Hell, my organs are so deflated I can feel them TOUCHING EACH OTHER. I truly cannot describe the feeling. It‚Äôs so different. The feeling is something I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

I didn‚Äôt even realize how much of a nuisance my flatulence was until it was gone. 

It will not be missed.

I got you! A doctor will inject a syringe of Botox into your cricopharyngeus sphincter, aka the muscle you swallow with to temporarily paralyze it so it can allow air back up. The hopes are that by paralyzing it once, it will reset the function and allow you to permanently burp normally. The paralysis is temporary, the effects are hopefully forever.

Regurgitating is a super odd experience and so is burping. when I could finally burp, it was so weird, the burps just tasted like the food I ate. Crazy. It doesn‚Äôt taste like vomit and I haven‚Äôt thrown up since the procedure but honestly my Emetophobia has gotten a lot better. Possibly partially due to treatment but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have gotten this far in my recovery journey without the surgery. FYI, I‚Äôm not fully recovered, I‚Äôm just doing a lot better. Also. When I first looked into this procedure I had the same worries. I barely even think about it anymore. Wishing you well!

I AM SO EXCITED!

My 11 year old (they/them) got approved for the Botox injection!!! Scheduled for late august !!! 
Dr Adam Rubin in st Clair shores Michigan is going to do it! I found him on the Reddit page. He did the research and found out they're able to have it done! We weren't sure with the age. 

I could cry. Nobody was believing me about my child's condition. Nobody. Even their dad. I KNEW it was this since I found out about it last summer. Finally. Someone believes me. And diagnosed them! 

I could cry. I am so excited right now. My poor child has been living in pain after every meal and every sip of water. The amount of skipped meals was astronomical......  IM SO EXCITED!!!!

Title    : One year out!
Selftext :
So my now 12 year olds one year date from the last surgery is tomorrow and I'd like to do a recap for those who are interested for kids! ‚ù§Ô∏è

-We used dr Adam Rubin in st Clair shores Michigan. 
-they did a child size dose in spring last year and it resulted in 3 burps only. 
-did an adult size dosage December 13 22 and the very next day was burping like a man. 
-very little discomfort 
-trouble swallowing for maybe a week (I say trouble lightly. Like a sore throat)
-has been burping like a grown man since!!!!!!!!
-weened off heartburn meds about 4-5 months after the surgery because it didn't subside right after surgery 



So all in all I highly suggest this for anyone whose child has these issues. Which were 

-nausea (had extreme emetaphobia from it which is gone)
-gas pain 
-stomach cramps from HELL
-frog noises
-heartburn
-air bubbles
-skipped meals due to pain being a result 
-missing outtings due to pain and fear of a gas bubble. 

Since then they're ALLLLLLLL gone. Every symptom. EVERYTHING. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

SAME HERE. I‚Äôve been able to manage avoiding stomach gas by controlling my diet before my pregnancy. But now that I‚Äôm pregnant, no matter what I eat, I get the gurgles, chest pains etc. 

Lying down used to help and eventually the gas would travel down to become farts‚Ä¶but now, maybe it‚Äôs the slow digestive system‚Ä¶even if I lie down for a few hours, the gas is still in my stomach so when I get up I still gurgle. 

The only thing that can release the gas is when I need to throw up. I cough to trigger it and air vomit comes out. Then followed by actual vomit. But now my morning sickness has died down so that doesn‚Äôt work. 

Did anything help? Or is it just going to be 9 months of this. I‚Äôm only at 14 weeks.

Spicy food, hot soups, soupy noodles, fizzy drinks. These I get symptoms from because I intake a lot of air when consuming them.

Other foods: apples, raw carrots, alcohol. 

Or talking and laughing when eating. Or being nervous. Or having nose allergies (guess from the sniffing). 

I guess what triggers gas for each person is different! I‚Äôm quite lucky in that if I carefully control what I eat (eg at home) I can generally avoid the symptoms. But of course, one slip up then üòµ

Not saying it‚Äôs exclusive for non-burpers (I know burpers who have this too, but also know lots of people who‚Äôs never experienced vomiting through their nose), but was wondering if there could be an association like emetophobia and RCPD, though not exclusive. When I witness other people vomit it just seems a lot more gentle?! The vomit just comes out, not a lot of sounds. For me it‚Äôs so violent. I recall my flatmate in uni commented on how disgusting it sounded was when I threw up (threw up a lot when drunk) üòÇ

Yes!!! I was wondering whether it was related to no burp too. I can swallow pills (I put the pill in my mouth, put some water in the mouth to move the pill to the back of my mouth, then take another sip to swallow) but I hate / fear doing it. It‚Äôs worse when I have gas, and I feel like there‚Äôs already so much pressure pushing up against my throat so swallowing something ‚Äòbig‚Äô (as opposed to letting tiny bits go down when you eat) is the last thing I want to do. I also feel like I end up swallowing air when taking pills which doesn‚Äôt help with the gas.

I got a really bad stomach bug later in high school and I think that is when the gurgling started. I‚Äôm not sure if that was the cause but it was around that time. I didn‚Äôt know it was caused by the fact I couldn‚Äôt burp until years later when I found an online forum with people saying the same thing (pre Reddit days).

You basically have to trigger your vomit reflex, but only air comes out, which is still horrible. I learned this method from someone else in this sub: repeatedly tap the back of your tongue with a toothbrush until you want to gag. That worked better for me than finger down my throat because I always struggled to do it properly for fear of actually throwing up.

Title    : Post-Botox diary - success 
Selftext :
I had 50 units from Dr Hicklin on Monday. Here is my diary so far.

Day one:
The injection was fine and just felt like a normal injection, it wasn‚Äôt painful but felt weird and unnatural obviously, but fine.

Straight after injection I felt a bit light headed but it went after around 10 minutes. 

My throat felt slightly strange and slightly painful when I swallowed for the whole day but nothing terrible.

Day two:

The throat pain has passed and I feel normal however my voice feels weak.

Eating feels normal and I am having unusual gurgles in my throat after meals and feel very full even when eating small amount.

Day three:

Slow swallow has definitely started. Feels like you‚Äôre about to choke after a bite of food until you have some water then it mostly goes. It isn‚Äôt actually too bad you just need to get used to it. I‚Äôm guessing it will get worse though as it‚Äôs only day three.

Having lots of small involuntary microburps

Day four:
 
A couple of microburps throughout the day. Slow swallow is a bit difficult but fine if I don‚Äôt have dry foods and have water whilst eating.

In the evening I started drinking carbonated drinks to see if I could burp. I ended up having around 10 proper burps.

Day five:

Slow swallow is still here but easily manageable. I‚Äôm now having proper burps without having to drink carbonated drinks to trigger them. However they only come out if I turn my head to the side.

Title    : It's so hard to get referral
Selftext :
I visited my GP in Toronto and asked for a referral to Dr. Jun Lin for R-CPD. My doctor said he's never heard of the condition and mentioned he's seen hundreds of patients with similar symptoms like inability to burp, bloating, and flatulence, but only treats them symptomatically. He claimed he can't refer me to a laryngologist because it's a GI issue. I've already seen a GI specialist who diagnosed me with acid reflux and IBS, but I'm convinced I have R-CPD. I pushed for the referral, and he said he'd contact Dr. Lin's office to see if they'd accept me. I'm worried he might just be trying to avoid giving me the referral :(

Title    : Unexpected Reaction During Botox Procedure - why did it happened?
Selftext :
Yesterday, I had a Botox treatment (50 units) at Dr. Lin's office in Toronto. I haven't started butping yet, might take a few days. The procedure began with a numbing spray, followed by the insertion of a camera through my nasal passage. Dr. Lin then administered a numbing injection to my throat before injecting the Botox. It took her about 5-10 seconds to locate the muscle, and I felt a slight pinch in my throat. While the pain wasn't too intense, as soon as the Botox was injected, I suddenly became extremely dizzy and lightheaded. My entire body began sweating, and I felt as though I might pass out. The doctor mentioned that my lips had turned pale. After the procedure, the nurse checked my blood pressure, which was very low, and it took around 15 minutes for me to feel normal again. I didn't get a chance to ask the doctor why this happened.

Title    : Post Botox Relief and Side effects
Selftext :
Hello fellow burpers and no burpers, I'm following up on my last post regarding experience with botox procedure. 

(Please note that all of these symptoms started after I had COVID, and before that, I was able to burp normally.)

I had Botox 6 days ago at Dr. Jun Lin's office in Toronto. Right after the procedure, my symptoms (bloating, gas, acid reflux) worsened for about 3 days. However, on the 4th day, I started to experience small burps, and now on day 7, I'm having almost constant micro burps. The relief has been incredible‚Äîit feels like my whole body has become lighter. I've noticed significant relief in my chest, and I feel like I can finally take full, deep breaths again. Although, the slow swallow is real and bothering me, I'm hopeful that it will go away soonish.

Here are some symptoms that have improved after Botox:

1. Bloating and trapped gas: My stomach always felt tight, like it was about to burst. Feel so much better now


2. Chest tightness and difficulty breathing: For the last 4 years, I wasn‚Äôt able to take deep breaths, but now I can.


3. Tachycardia: My heart rate was consistently above 100, and I was diagnosed with tachycardia. Since the Botox, it's been consistently in the 80-100 bpm range.



I'm not entirely sure why Botox has relieved my chest tightness, breathing issues, and tachycardia, but I'm trying to explore the connection between them.

One thing I‚Äôm curious about: how can I turn these small burps into larger ones? I‚Äôve tried but haven‚Äôt been successful. It seems like I can burp small ones infinitely, but how do I know if there‚Äôs still gas trapped inside? I'm confused and excited at the same time!

Selftext :
My resting heart beat was always in the range of 95-110 and sometimes even higher, and I've been diagnosed with tachycardia. I've been monitoring it after the botox and when I started burping, it is actually 80-90 now. I'm surprised and wondering what could be the connection.

Hey everyone!

I just want to preface this with: I know i‚Äôm still SUPER early on in my botox journey, but I just have a few questions for those of you who have been through botox before so I know what I should maybe expect!

So like I mentioned, the microburps have definitely started! They aren‚Äôt as frequent as I thought they‚Äôd be‚Ä¶is that normal for this early? Because I was told i‚Äôd be burping a LOT, like obnoxiously!

Am I supposed to push out burps? Or do they usually just come out without effort? I‚Äôm still not quite sure how to do it yet! 

I have had a couple louder sounding burps, but they still sound a little weird so far! Lol! About how far along until they sound more normal?

Last question: Turning my head has been helping a TON! It does look weird in public though, lol. About how long until you didn‚Äôt have to turn your head as much?

Thanks so much!

Title    : Couldn‚Äôt handle the local anesthesia procedure :(
Selftext :
Just attempted to have the local anesthesia botox procedure done in Toronto but couldn‚Äôt handle the discomfort/pain unfortunately :(

Could not stop gagging soooo much and I actually found it super unbearably painful! I don‚Äôt have any medical anxiety and I have a pretty high pain tolerance normally! I tried so hard to go through with it but really could not handle the sharp pain or gagging. 

From what I‚Äôve read, most people found the local anesthesia procedure to be uncomfortable but not unbearable. But I found it completely unbearable lol! I have had other invasive procedures done but this was truly the most painful. The numbing needles were tolerable but I could not handle the pain of the Botox injection.

Did anyone else have a negative experience like this? Im waiting to get the procedure done under general anesthesia now. Hopefully the wait won‚Äôt be long!

That‚Äôs great I‚Äôm glad it went well for you!! It wasn‚Äôt pressure I was feeling but a very sharp pain when the Botox needle was put into the muscle. 

It felt like she had gone in and out a few times to get the right spot, and each time it went in it killed so bad!! She didn‚Äôt end up actually injecting any Botox because I couldn‚Äôt stop gagging lol. Or maybe it‚Äôs because she was trying to find the right spot. It was a strange combination of reallyyyy bad pain and also gagging from the sensation of the needle being in the muscle. Overall just couldn‚Äôt handle it and had to tell her to stop. 

Also, right after the appointment I had no numbness in my throat at all. Normal feeling. I was able to swallow food about 15 minutes later. But a month ago when I had the original nasoendoscopy, I was super numb for about an hour after. Could barely swallow water, so now I‚Äôm wondering if I maybe wasn‚Äôt numbed enough today?

Did you gag a lot when the Botox needle went in as well??

Omg 4 injections and only with local anesthesia 1 time!? That‚Äôs amazing that you‚Äôre able to handle the pain and discomfort! Oh no I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not working for you yet :( I really hope it works for you the 5th time around.

Hi!! Wow I had no idea they would even do the procedure without any local anesthesia. That‚Äôs great that you were able to tolerate it! But sorry it was painful for you too :( Yes the gagging is so strange! as soon as the Botox needle went in it was like the feeling of having something stuck in your throat and choking, causing me to keep gagging. It was from the outside of the throat. I hope the Botox worked for you!

Hi! Sorry just seeing this now. I ended up going for the in-office procedure back in August but didn‚Äôt go through with it because I was panicking/gagging way too much lol. Not to scare you! So many people do it in office and find it super quick and easy. I just couldn‚Äôt handle it so now I have an appointment with her for the procedure under anesthesia on April 25th! Took a super long time to get the appointment but so excited! 

Did you have your consultation with her yet?

Title    : General Anesthesia Procedure Soon in Toronto
Selftext :
Getting the procedure done under general anesthesia end of April and I‚Äôm so excited but also so insanely nervous. I‚Äôve been waiting almost a whole year for this appointment but now that it‚Äôs here I‚Äôm getting sooo nervous for the slow swallow.

Does it actually feel like you‚Äôre choking? Is it something that‚Äôs going to bother me all day even when I‚Äôm not eating? Is there anything that helps make it better?Has anyone else had it done under anesthesia with Dr Lin in Toronto ON? Idk why I‚Äôm so nervous for it lol üò≠

So I found this reddit page back in May 2023. Made an appointment with my family doctor and begged her for a referral to Dr. Lin at St. Micheal‚Äôs. She was super understanding and said yes.

I had the initial appointment sometime in June 2023 I think, with Dr. Lin. Just explained my symptoms to her, she did the camera up my nose test and said based on my symptoms it sounds like RCPD. 

They booked me for the in-office treatment end of August 2023. I went to go do it but found the numbing and whole preparation so uncomfortable and painful I couldn‚Äôt get through it. (But I ended up stopping her before the Botox even went in. From what I‚Äôve read, everyone else was able to manage the in-office injection. So not sure why I acted that way lol) 

So they said they‚Äôd book me for the procedure under general anesthesia instead but that it would be a long wait. Waited about 8 months and finally had it yesterday! 

Besides the long wait the process was pretty easy. I haven‚Äôt had any burps yet since it‚Äôs less than 24 hours but I‚Äôm sure the wait will end up being worth it!

Finally burping 5 days post Botox! So happy! It only happens when I sit a certain way, but still very happy.

But I‚Äôm also a bit concerned because I still have all the usual RCPD symptoms. Lots of gurgles like usual, bloating, gas etc. 

The burps only come out at the end of my throat gurgles right now. I‚Äôm just curious at what point the gurgles will go away and just be burps? 

I see a lot of people writing how the ability to burp was life changing for them, but although I can burp now, I don‚Äôt feel any relief yet! Maybe it‚Äôs still just too early though?

It‚Äôs been exactly a month since I had the procedure and it has literally been life changing. If you‚Äôre debating getting it done, please do!!! But suddenly the past 4 days I‚Äôm struggling to burp again and experiencing all the usual RCPD symptoms. I forgot how awful the symptoms were! Went from 10-15 relieving burps a day to literally none! 

Already spoke with my doctor and she said just to monitor and drink lots of fizzy drinks.

For those of you who felt the Botox wore off, were you able to gain the ability to burp back yourself or did you get a second round?

I had the Botox procedure about 8 weeks ago. The first 4 weeks were completely life changing! I could cry thinking about it lol! All my usual RCPD symptoms went away completely and I felt amazing for the first time in forever. I was able to easily burp huge burps lol that gave me so much relief! 

Since 5 weeks post-procedure, I get 8-10 very small burps a day and it‚Äôs really hard to get them out. Gurgles and constant gas are back. But technically I am still burping, so I don‚Äôt know if I should get the Botox again??? I burp,  but there is no relief because they are small. I only felt relief from the large burps that I can‚Äôt seem to get out anymore. Not sure what to do!

Title    : This changed my life. Please get the treatment if you can!
Selftext :
It‚Äôs been exactly 7 months since I got the Botox treatment and words cannot describe how grateful I am for Reddit, Botox and the ENT who did my Botox lol! 

My horrible RCPD symptoms completely disappeared about a month after treatment. My side effects (slow swallow) were really annoying but only lasted a week. 

I basically never ever have gas anymore. I haven‚Äôt had annoying throat gurgles in 6 months. One of my worst symptoms was horrible hypersalivation that lasted for hours whenever I drank or ate too much. I was constantly in discomfort. Every party, dinner or get together was ruined. I could never be present because I was always in pain, or holding in gas, or having pressure in my throat etc.

Not to be dramatic but I can actually cry tears of joy if I think about how much this is changed my life lol! I know there are so many worse issues to have, but being in pain/discomfort 90% of your life is exhausting and depressing. Please don‚Äôt undermine your symptoms when talking to your doctor. 

My best advice would be to go to your doctor prepared with medical articles/examples to show them that RCPD is real. And look into ENT‚Äôs who treat RCPD in your area so that you can request a referral to a specific doctor. 

I was terrified to get this treatment done but I would do it again if needed in a heart beat. I wake up so thankful everyday for the relief I feel and I hope and pray everyone dealing with RCPD can feel this relief asap!!!! Take this as your sign not to be scared and to go for the treatment! üòä

Title    : Foods you avoid with RCPD
Selftext :
Hey guys! Because of tiktok I learned 2 days ago that I have RCPD! I knew that I had never been able to burp since I was a child, but after some research I realized that I experience literally every symptom of RCPD! A huge one for me was bloating, as I have been dealing with extremely bad bloating every single day that makes me look pregnant for 2-3 years, and I could not figure out why, and learning that it is due to this has made me feel so validated knowing that there is a reason for my concerns. Also, I am in Raleigh, and scheduled an appointment today with Dr. Holmes to discuss the botox procedure!

However, I am curious as to what foods you guys avoid to prevent bloating and discomfort. I know that some bad triggers for me are pasta, fried foods, sushi, etc., and although certain sodas don't bother me too much (i drink them very slowly to avoid discomfort), alcoholic seltzers and other type drinks are a huge no for me. Besides these, there are many other foods that give me issues that I am still unaware of. What other foods do you guys find bothers you that you may try to avoid, and I might try to avoid those as well to see if I can find some ease before I possibly get the procedure done! :)

Title    : Rant: it is so hard being a girl in my 20s with rcpd
Selftext :
I'm 22 years old and a fresh college graduate. i discovered around May of this year that I had rcpd through tiktok and my life has made so much more sense after finding out. I have always had the painful hiccups, the gurgling, croaking, etc. and most importantly (to me at least) the BLOATING. my bloating started becoming noticeable when i was around 19 but it wasn't consistent... it seemed that certain foods triggered it so i knew that if i was going to be going out or doing something where i wanted to look good i would avoid certain foods that day. Now, i'm 22 and for the past 10-11 months, no matter WHAT i eat, even days that i BARELY eat at all (today is one of those days) i'm still visibly bloated by the end of the day. I legitimately look pregnant, i feel sick and drained, and my confidence is almost nonexistent. Today i ate a small meal for breakfast and then i ate half of a cheeseburger for lunch, and i was busy driving and at a football game, so i had nothing else today except for water. i got around 11pm not having eaten since maybe 3, and i just cried as i stood in the shower because i look so pregnant. My stomach legitimately sticks out so far. It's not as bad and especially not as painful as it would be had i eaten dinner, but it is so soul crushing that i can't go a single day anymore without this. When i want to go out to bars on weekends with my friends, I spend the entire night feeling self conscious and ducking my stomach in as far as possible without being obvious to make myself feel better. I'm single and I want to date and i want a relationship, but how am i going to be comfortable with someone knowing that every night i'm 6 feet wider than i am in the morning, and also knowing that i'm probably only skinny in the morning because i'm loudly blowing the room up in my sleep all night long. When i complain to my friends about being bloated it's always a "Oh me too!" except it's not because none of them physically bloat out the way that i do. im very enero phobic so any time that i have air vomited has been involuntary and although i feel better afterwards i hate it and i would never make myself do it voluntarily. i can't afford the botox because it doesn't seem that insurance covers it and even if i could muster up the money, there's a huge chance that it wouldnt even work and that feels so discouraging. I'm so tired of living my life this way and i want relief so bad and i don't know what to do. today was so tough and i just needed a space to vent to people who understood me.

Title    : My insurance denied my claim for the botox... what next?
Selftext :
I have been talking to the doctor in my state who does the procedure, and when talking to the staff they were under the impression that my insurance would approve the procedure due to the large number of RCPD symptoms that I have, but unfortunately I found out on Friday that they denied the claim and my only option is to pay $4300 upfront, which as a recent college grad with a car payment and rent, that's out of the question.... in fact it would probably take me over a year to even save that kind of money on my current budget... My family thinks that I should reach out to BCBS myself and appeal the claim, but I'm curious how much luck other people have had with this? The procedure is a huge necessity for me but I just feel really discouraged by being denied. Any suggestions or ideas are encouraged and appreciated !!! :)

When I was a kid and a teenager I knew I couldn't burp but never thought it was a problem. Wasn't until my early 20's when all the symptoms really started to appear. Now i'm nauseous, outwardly bloated, and sick all the time from practically everything I eat and drink.

Title    : Botox + insurance 
Selftext :
Found out via tiktok 3 years ago that the issues i‚Äôd suffered my entire life were RCPD. Then, I was a senior in college and was really starting to notice my symptoms worsening. Now, in my mid 20s, I am dealing with chronic nausea and feeling overall unwell all the time. 
I‚Äôm in NC, and in late 2022 I called the office of the one doctor at the time who did the procedure, and when they reached out to my insurance (BCBS) the claim was denied and I was quoted over $4k. 
Anyways, two years later I‚Äôm still here suffering and wanting to consider the procedure and working with insurance again. I saw from the map that there is a place in both Winston and Charlotte that are offering the procedure, which are both much closer to me. 

Can anyone offer any advice or help with working with getting this approved by insurance? I am getting desperate and cannot afford this out of pocket.

Title    : Possible R-CPD?
Selftext :
I‚Äôm a 23-year-old male, and I‚Äôve never been able to burp. I thought people usually don‚Äôt burp. If I did, it must have been rare. I didn‚Äôt know this wasn‚Äôt normal until I saw a TikTok video last night. I‚Äôve read several posts here where people mention experiencing gurgling in the throat, but I don‚Äôt think I do. When I ‚Äúburp,‚Äù it‚Äôs usually just a dramatic head movement, leaning backward and then coming forward. People typically ask me if I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm just like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a ‚Äòburp.‚Äô‚Äù I‚Äôve never been able to make a sound. I have SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory), so it‚Äôs difficult for me to recollect events from the past since I don‚Äôt have the ability to mentally time travel, but I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever burped.

Some of the symptoms I experience are dysphagia, excessive flatulence, abdominal distention, cramps, and general GI discomfort (could just be bloating).

I know I need to see an ENT doctor, but I have Kaiser Medi-Cal. I‚Äôm based in the South Bay area of California, so I was wondering if there is anyone who was able to get treatment covered with Medi-Cal and where I should start. Any recommended physicians?

Since I have SDAM, I‚Äôve been trying to notice when I have a ‚Äúburp.‚Äù Sometimes, I‚Äôm able to but for the most part nothing comes out it would just be a movement of regurgitation. Sometimes air but no sound? Sometimes feels like a hiccup with sound? I don‚Äôt burp normally for sure. The dysphagia is more of my concern, I heard it‚Äôs the same muscle‚ÄîUES? I would always have to chug bunch fluid in order to swallow. I can‚Äôt eat food that is dry. I physically cannot swallow.

Thank you so much for such a thorough and thoughtful response. I definitely feel pressure in my throat and chest. I noticed that I actually attempt to ‚Äúburp‚Äù rather frequently. Sometimes it‚Äôs a micro burp, sometimes it‚Äôs just regurgitation without air coming out, and it could lead to air vomit. In fact, I just air vomited twice earlier; I truly don‚Äôt like how it feels in my chest. When the micro burps happen, I do feel some air bubble or a sound at the end of my throat, or just a pressure in my chest. This generally happens after I eat and is accompanied by flatulence. I don‚Äôt know if there is a buildup, but my body just suddenly regurgitate. Even if I can burp, it‚Äôs not relieving in any way. I apologize for the vagueness.

I never really had an appetite since I was a little kid. I always hated eating, probably due to dysphagia. Ever since I was little, I stored food in my mouth without swallowing (physically cannot). When my mother was not present, I would spit the food into the trashcan or toilet and flush it away. Despite my mother‚Äôs attempts to improve my appetite, including seeking medical intervention and administering medication, my condition did not improve. It‚Äôs pretty hard for me to vomit, only after a long time of trying. I had longstanding constipation, which has recently improved with medication, but it still feels somewhat incomplete.

I apologize if I wasn‚Äôt clear. My body regurgitated (as in the action), but no food came up. If I were to describe it, it would be more like dry heaving. I guess it would be reflux since no food came up. I have ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder) due to sensory issues. The texture, appearance, and smell of food make me not want to eat it. I guess with the dysphagia, it has exacerbated the condition. Therefore, I‚Äôve never had a good relationship with food and have a lack of interest in eating.

My BMI has been around 13-14 since I was around six years old or younger. I went through treatment last year, and the flatulence got worse. I was like a fart bomb, constantly farting. It got better but is still excessive. Maybe since I‚Äôm eating more, there‚Äôs more gas. Regardless of how much Gas-X I take, I look like I‚Äôm pregnant. I thought it might be from the fatty liver due to refeeding (my liver enzymes went up to 200, probably from that and olanzapine for weight gain), but I‚Äôm still on the verge of being underweight, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm thinking the gas is what‚Äôs making the stomach distended. Do stomachs of individuals with R-CPD always look distended?

I‚Äôd say reflux is often associated with acid, which would make sense that some people experience the burning sensation. Mine is also without heartburn. I definitely relate to the air pressure in my chest. The bubbles in the bottom of my throat burst, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be as loud as some people here say it is; it‚Äôs quite subtle. I actually don‚Äôt know my current BMI since I‚Äôm still going through ED treatment and they hide the numbers from you. I‚Äôd estimate it‚Äôs around 18.5, but it fluctuates. It could go lower if I don‚Äôt feel like eating.

Currently, I‚Äôve lost about 11 lbs since getting out of residential treatment, and my stomach still looks very distended. Even during my colonoscopy to figure out the ‚Äúnausea,‚Äù (dry heaving) when I had to drink the liquid that made me go to the bathroom about 40 times, my bowel/colon was completely empty but still bloated. I even took GasX, which I think R-CPD could just be a contributing factor since I‚Äôm eating more. I wonder why the GI doctor that did my colonoscopy didn‚Äôt say anything if they saw bubbles there. Maybe it‚Äôs not because of R-CPD but just fat on my stomach, but still doesn‚Äôt make much sense.

The lowest BMI I‚Äôve had in my adulthood was probably in the 13‚Äôs. I just don‚Äôt like food in general, but I prefer seafood. I don‚Äôt like condiments and sauces either. I like the smell of pesto but don‚Äôt like the texture, so I refuse to eat it. I‚Äôm usually fine with most meat, though. I have trouble with bready textures, so no bread, pizza, noodles, etc. for me. If I‚Äôve gone a long time without eating, then I can hear my stomach growl, but it doesn‚Äôt feel empty to me. Even when I know it is, like after my colonoscopy prep. When I feel hungry, I still don‚Äôt want to eat unless I absolutely have to, which I think is vital to my recovery to address the dysphagia, or we would just be going in circles.

I want to be able to sustain/maintain a healthy weight without going to treatment. Also, going to treatment is preventing me from looking for a job. Since my weight is preventing me from taking ADHD meds, which they don‚Äôt give if you have an active ED. My executive dysfunction was so bad without medication. I haven‚Äôt been medicated until just the past few months. I was able to convince my psychiatrist to give me non-stimulant ADHD medication, and my overall mood/energy is so much better but still doesn‚Äôt fix all of my issues, and I‚Äôm on the higher dose side. I know what it‚Äôs like being hungry but doesn‚Äôt make me want to eat, and I can surpass/ignore that hunger cue. It‚Äôs not unbearable.

Title    : Botox Worsen Dysphagia?
Selftext :
I‚Äôve had longstanding issues with dysphagia dating back to childhood, particularly with initiating the swallow reflex. Most of the food I consume has to be chewed for a long time before I can swallow it in tiny bits, often with a lot of water. Sometimes food particles get stuck, and I‚Äôve learned to drink a lot of water before I start choking. Occasionally, I keep chewing and add more food, which then just accumulates in my mouth and I would just spit them out. I also sometimes experience a gurgling sound at the bottom of my throat when drinking water.

I‚Äôm getting CP Botox soon for my R-CPD. I understand that most people generally recover quickly, with some even able to work the next day. I also struggle with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and my weight is slowly drifting down. I‚Äôm curious for those with dysphagia prior to the Botox injection‚Äîdid it worsen after the procedure?

Selftext :
My throat hurt a bit when I woke up from the anesthesia. Swallowing the apple juice they gave me was painful, but it felt a bit easier, like there was less of a blockage. I‚Äôve had chronic dysphagia since I was a kid, so maybe I have both R-CPD and A-CPD? I‚Äôve heard from others on this subreddit that the throat might hurt more the next day, so we‚Äôll see! Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Did your guys‚Äô throat hurt more in the following days? The surgeon put me off of work for a week to weight restore due to my ED. I feel like I can swallow okay by initiating the swallowing reflex right now without pain. Excited for my future burps!

pretty much i got mild rhabdo from the depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent the anesthesiologist use for intubation. so in the few minutes that it was doing its thing to relax my muscles, it caused damage to my skeletal muscles and had a rapid breakdown so it released toxins in my bloodstream. but it‚Äôs super mild though and they flushed them out with iv fluids.

Title    : Stress and anxiety seems to have made things worse
Selftext :
I‚Äôve been through a lot of stress recently and my gurgles have been a hell of a lot worse. 
Gurgling whenever I have panic attacks more, and since I‚Äôm emetophobic the nausea it gives often freaks me out.

I‚Äôve had a constant tight chest feeling (not painful) that feels like when I have trapped air. It makes me feel like I need to hyperventilate and it‚Äôs horrible. 

Does anyone‚Äôs gurgling get more prominent when you are anxious/stressed? 
I cant keep doing this honestly because it makes me feel nauseous and I‚Äôm so afraid to v*mit! I know it has never made me v*mit but nonethless I hate it. 


Side note: Do taking tablets make gurgling worse too? I‚Äôm a bit under the weather at the moment and I‚Äôve had to take paracetamol and my gurgling has been worse after doing that in the past (caused two air v*miting incidents which scared me a lot!). I‚Äôm unsure though because I could just be stressed out about it.

This might be totally irrelevant, but when I was on birth control my gurgles were so bad. Like I had to just sit/lie still and I got no relief. Every single time I ate it was bad, and that would continue for hours. Since stopping, the gurgles went back to being more occasional and mainly immediately after eating and occasionally for the hours after. Sure, I‚Äôd much rather burp, but It was really scary going from noburp being something I can live with to something I was immediately looking into treatment for.
This might be totally worthless, but since theres a lot of hormone changes involved in pregnancy, it occurred to me how taking hormones in contraceptives affected me and my stomach.

Title    : Birth control made gurgles worse
Selftext :
Now, I hadn‚Äôt really had much problem with my no-burp issue. Sure sometimes after certain foods or after chewing gum or something it‚Äôd get worse, but it was never to the point where I desperately wanted treatment or something.

I started birth control for some hormonal reasons and instantly I was having really bad gas that‚Äôd feel almost trapped in my chest and I‚Äôd gurgle uncontrollably all day long. It made eating difficult and me terrified that I‚Äôd need to get treatment fast despite the fact I‚Äôm fearful of the treatment somewhat. I at first thought it was diet, so I changed some stuff/cut stuff out and nothing. I was getting so painfully bloated and would just lie down until I felt less uncomfortable, but nothing helped.
I came off the pill quickly because I was having a very serious emotional reaction, and all my worries and gurgling discomfort went with it! I‚Äôm back to my managable gurgling that comes out at it pleases and not uncomfortably for hours straight. It was like I‚Äôd jugged a soda and eaten a massive fatty pizza every single day no matter what I did. 

Did anyone else have this issue or was this just a weird experience. Maybe it had nothing to do with the pill - my partner wondered if it was all the constant stress/upset I was getting from the pill. I blame it purely because of how nauseous it made me aswell. Who knows, just thought I would share.

Title    : Air vomit??
Selftext :
So I‚Äôm emetophobic and i‚Äôve had two instances in the past when I was really gassy where I suddenly (and without my control) expelled a load of air while trying to push out a gurgle. Happened twice and was really relieving.

Now, today I ate the same food that caused it last time and I also happen to have a cough. About 5 minutes ago I coughed pretty hard as an attempt to dislodge some crap in my chest and I suddenly let out a load of air again. I immediately panicked even though I didn‚Äôt feel any v* come up, didn‚Äôt gag etc. now my throat is gurgling like crazy, I feel awful and a little nauseous from the panic and I‚Äôm too scared to cough properly to clear my throat in fear it‚Äôll happen again. Unlike last time it gave me zero relief and my brain is convincing me I‚Äôm going to be sick even though I know that‚Äôs not realistic.

I‚Äôm freaking out. Is this a phenomenon anyone else has experienced? My partner assures me it‚Äôs just air being released and I‚Äôm not going to be sick because in her words ‚Äúthe body doesn‚Äôt just give up on being sick, it‚Äôd try a little harder.‚Äù I‚Äôm too scared to move, drink, eat etc. i hate this and I want normality.

This is quite possibly the most awkward thing I‚Äôve ever shared with the internet, but I (F) would also sometimes get abdominal pain from sex, and like you, it seemed to happen more when I was bloated‚Ä¶ but what I discovered was that having an orgasm would ‚Äúfix‚Äù it? If we messed around and I didn‚Äôt orgasm, I‚Äôd have stomach pain for hours. As soon as I‚Äôd orgasm, it would go away. At the time, I didn‚Äôt even know what R-CPD was (although I very clearly knew that the way my stomach ballooned up by the end of every day was not normal). I didn‚Äôt tell anybody about the pain or the solution, not even my partner, because I felt like I would sound absolutely insane, and possibly like this was some weird excuse to demand more sex acts from my partner. But it happened enough times and with the same results every single time that I‚Äôm sure this was the case. So I don‚Äôt know if the same applies to you, but boy would I love to hear that anybody else shares this finding!

‚Ä¶except I wasn‚Äôt throwing up. I just had never experienced burping outside of throwing up. 
I burped one more time by accident when I was maybe 16 or so (vigorously riding a bike, so also breathing hard) and haven‚Äôt burped since.

Title    : Tried a new tactic that seemed to work
Selftext :
I just wanted to share my experience here, as a lifetime no-burper. I‚Äôve spent my whole life struggling to get doctors to take me seriously. I‚Äôve been to gastroenterologists and had a million tests and they just tell me I have IBS. 

In recent years, I‚Äôve been developing reflux (which I suspect is from a lifetime of all that air stretching out everything in there). My family doctor put me on a PPI, which made my no-burp symptoms literally unbearable; I couldn‚Äôt even stay upright for a full workday. The throat nausea got so bad that I had to go home and lie down. I told my doctor this and she asked ‚Äúokay but did it help your reflux?‚Äù
I said I guessed it helped that somewhat, and she said ‚Äúwell then your reflux mustn‚Äôt be that bad, if you don‚Äôt want to keep taking it.‚Äù
So I dropped it with her, and I‚Äôve been living with no-burp symptoms and reflux since then. 

Recently, the reflux has been worsening and I finally have decided that I think I‚Äôm ready to get the Botox treatment. Even if it doesn‚Äôt help the reflux, being able to burp should let me go on a PPI. I want to go to Chicago for it and get it done with the best, but I‚Äôm also very concerned about the reflux getting worse after the Botox. My last endoscopy was 15 years ago, before I had reflux symptoms, and I was kind of worried that I could be developing Barrett‚Äôs esophagus or something, from the chronic reflux. I wanted to have another endoscopy to make sure I didn‚Äôt have anything serious going on in there, before I reached out to doctor Bastian to get the process started. But with nobody taking R-CPD seriously, how was I going get anybody to agree to give me an endoscopy??

I called around to a number of local ENTs and gastroenterologists, asking if any of their providers were familiar with R-CPD. Nobody was. So I finally made the decision to just try anyway, and I picked a large gastroenterology group in the area. 

It had been fifteen years since I‚Äôd seen a gastroenterologist and they made me fill out a lot of paperwork and asked if I had any other diagnoses they should know about‚Ä¶ and I put ‚ÄúR-CPD‚Äù. Before the appointment, I practiced pronouncing ‚ÄúRetrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction‚Äù. When I went in, the nurse went over my medical history with me, and I just confidently told her I had Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction. She put that right in my chart. I explained that I was looking to go to Chicago to get treatment for R-CPD with Doctor Bastian but I was wanting to get an endoscopy done first. I carefully presented all of this never mentioning that I‚Äôve never actually spoken to Doctor Bastian, or that the only person to ever diagnose me with R-CPD is‚Ä¶ me. And she dutifully noted it all down, and then told me that the doctor would be in in just a minute.

The doctor was not in in just a minute. Instead, after like five minutes, they sent in a medical student to chat with me a little more, take some notes and stuff. And then about five more minutes after the student left, the doctor did come in, and he asked a few basic questions and then said, ‚Äúand so I see you have been diagnosed with R-CPD‚Ä¶ and what kind of symptoms are you having with that, like excessive flatulence, distended abdomen, gurgling noises in you throat‚Ä¶?‚Äù

All of this from a facility that had checked when I‚Äôd first called and none of their doctors were familiar with R-CPD!
He definitely did not seem well-versed in R-CPD or anything, but he had a basic understanding for sure.

He ended up agreeing I should have an endoscopy and due to logistics with a ride, I scheduled that at a different one of their facilities, with a different gastroenterologist. That procedure was this week, and when that doctor came in to talk to me before the procedure, he too conveyed a base level of familiarity with R-CPD.

Obviously I can‚Äôt know for sure what happened‚Ä¶ but if I had to wager a guess, it‚Äôs that no doctor wants to admit that their patient has been officially diagnosed with a disease they‚Äôve never heard of. So before talking to me, they did a quick internet search and familiarized themselves with the basics. 

In contrast, every time I‚Äôd seen a doctor before, I‚Äôd been describing all my symptoms, trying to tell them how I read about this on the internet, trying to convince them that it‚Äôs a real thing that I think I have‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôd looked at me like I was a crazy idiot. 

So that‚Äôs my advice to all of you. If you are like me and you‚Äôve known for years exactly what your problem is, just stop waiting for a doctor to validate you, and validate yourself. Introduce yourself to a new doctor and straight-up tell them you have R-CPD. Don‚Äôt sound apologetic, don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI know this is weird,‚Äù don‚Äôt try to convince them it‚Äôs a real thing‚Ä¶ just present it like it‚Äôs a fact, as widely accepted as it would be if you were saying ‚ÄúI have diabetes‚Äù or something. 

(For the record, the endoscopy showed a hiatial hernia and inflammation in the esophagus, grade B. He said it‚Äôs not something to panic about, but it‚Äôs definitely something where he would normally recommend starting a PPI now, before it gets worse, though he knows in my case, I cannot do that. He told me I‚Äôm doing the right thing by trying to handle it now, and wished my luck with the Botox procedure. I‚Äôm currently in the process of selling my place and moving across town, but I plan to reach out to Bastian next month and get the ball rolling.)

Oh no, I totally agree! I‚Äôm glad they did, and I wish all my doctors for the past however many years had taken it seriously and had taken the time to google it rather than to just dismiss me. I just thought it was interesting that to get to this point, I had to stop asking doctors to give me an R-CPD diagnosis and instead tell them that R-CPD was my diagnosis.

I felt the same way as you for about 40 years. The bloating and throat gurgling haven‚Äôt gotten a lot worse, and I‚Äôve gotten better at knowing what I can and can‚Äôt eat to trigger the worst of it. I still have some days with bad discomfort, and I finish most every day looking super pregnant, but I‚Äôm not trying to win any beauty contests, so oh well.

For me, the worst thing is that around the age of 35, I started developing acid reflux. (From what I understand, this is very common in those of us with R-CPD). I‚Äôve tried going on medicine for the acid reflux, but every med I‚Äôve tried has made the R-CPD symptoms completely unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt even work a full day on the meds, because I‚Äôd get so bloated and nauseous that I‚Äôd have to go home and lie down. So instead, I just lived with the reflux. 

I‚Äôm now at the point where the lining of my throat is starting to change and the doctor has told me I really need to to go on meds for the reflux, or I‚Äôm going to have an increased risk of cancer. So now I‚Äôm making plans to get the Botox done. Even if I don‚Äôt care about relieving the symptoms I‚Äôve had my whole life, at least I should be able to take a PPI for my reflux. 

I haven‚Äôt actually had the procedure yet so I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs worth it or not‚Ä¶ but I can say now that I wish I would have started this process earlier. I know the Botox is expensive and it has some uncomfortable temporary side effects, but none of that is why I chose not to do it. I just felt like I didn‚Äôt really NEED it, because I‚Äôve been living with this forever and I‚Äôve dealt with it fine. But the thing is, unless you‚Äôre one of the few who can teach yourself to burp on your own, R-CPD pretty much never goes away or gets better on its own. All it can do is get worse or cause more complications as you age. So even not having had the procedure yet, I‚Äôd say if you have the means to have the procedure now, while you know there‚Äôs an issue but you don‚Äôt yet have any major complications from it, just do it!

How much Botox did you get?
Also, I see this regurgitating talk all the time, but since you seem thorough, I want to ask: what exactly does this mean? Is there literally giant blobs of semi-chewed food like projectile-vomiting out of your mouth every time it happens? Or is it just like a little bit of food comes up into your mouth, but you can take a drink of water and swallow it back down and it‚Äôs not noticeable? 
I‚Äôve been living with this condition forever and as my acid reflux gets worse, I think I need to finally get the procedure, so I can go on PPIs if nothing else‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm terrified of the regurgitation!

I‚Äôve burped twice in my entire life, both times when I was a kid. Both times, I thought I was vomiting and had a moment of sheer panic when it happened, until I realized it was only a burp‚Ä¶ and then I was just confused!
Once I took a deep breath in and went swimming underwater, holding my breath for as long as I could, and when I finally came up and let the air out, a huge burp came out with it.
The other time, I was riding my bike and pedaling really hard and I went over a bump in the road and a burp came out. 
That was 30-some years ago and nothing since then!

Title    : Started the process for an appointment at BVI-question for acid reflux meds
Selftext :
I called BVI today and left a voicemail to get scheduled for the Botox! I‚Äôve been planning on doing this ‚Äúeventually‚Äù for years, and I‚Äôm very excited and nervous. Evidently it may be a week before they actually call me back to get me scheduled‚Äîthey said they‚Äôve had an influx of calls since Bastian‚Äôs announcement! 

I have mostly silent reflux now, and I tried multiple OTC meds as well as going on a prescription PPI, but all of them made the no-burp symptoms absolutely unbearable. I opted to live with the constant sore throat instead. Taking three tums before I go to bed has prevented anything from coming up at night. I know that post-procedure, that‚Äôs not going to be enough and I‚Äôm going to want to go on some kind of acid reducer. My current primary care physician has been less than helpful with this whole R-CPD thing. I‚Äôm looking for a new PCP, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll have one in time. I‚Äôm assuming that once I can burp, I‚Äôll be able to handle acid reducing meds, so what has worked for you all after Botox? I think I could get my PCP to prescribe something, if I came in with confidence in what I wanted, since my latest endoscopy showed clear evidence of reflux (and a hiatial hernia).

This. I discovered this Reddit forum when it was in its infancy, years ago. When I first came across the description of the problem, I was shocked to find people talking about what I‚Äôd been dealing with my whole life, and I couldn‚Äôt believe that all of my ‚Äúcroaking‚Äù and bloating and gastrointestinal issues were from not being able to burp! It had never even occurred to me that burping was necessary! 

I watched as Bastian came up with the Botox solution and saw people getting cured left and right‚Ä¶ but I am afraid to throw up, the Botox sounded awful, it seemed like a huge ordeal, I kind of didn‚Äôt WANT to burp (like, it‚Äôs a little gross, right?) and I basically felt like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived with it this long; why change now?‚Äù

But as I entered into my late 30s and now early 40s, the condition is taking a toll on my body. I never had reflux when I was younger, but now I have a constant sore throat (from daytime silent reflux) and I‚Äôll wake up in the middle of the night sometimes with mouthfuls of stomach acid. I can‚Äôt treat the reflux because it makes the R-CPD symptoms unbearable. I had testing done earlier this year and although I didn‚Äôt have a hiatial hernia ten years ago, I have one now. There are changes to my throat now and I‚Äôm evidently in danger of developing Barrett‚Äôs esophagus. 

I‚Äôm getting this treated now (well, in October) because I can‚Äôt have this getting any worse‚Ä¶ but if I could go back in time and have it treated 8 or 9 years ago, before all of these things happened to me, I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat! Do it now, BEFORE R-CPD takes its toll on your body. Don‚Äôt wait until it causes potentially irreparable damage!

Title    : Botox but without fizzy drinks

I have my Botox procedure scheduled in Chicago in October but I‚Äôm a little nervous because I‚Äôve been reading a lot of people talking about how important it is to drink fizzy drinks so that you can practice burping. I have some weird sensory issues and I literally cannot stand bubbles. Like, the sensation of carbonation on my tongue absolutely freaks me out. I hate beer and soda. If there is a layer of bubbles atop my glass of milk, I‚Äôll get a spoon and skim them off before I drink it because I hate the feeling of the bubbles on my lips. I really do NOT want to have to consume carbonation, but I also don‚Äôt want to pay all this money for the procedure, only for it to fail because I refuse to drink soda. Has anybody had success learning to burp with the Botox WITHOUT intentionally ingesting fizzy beverages?

I had my Botox Tuesday morning with Hoesli. Starting yesterday afternoon and continuing into today, I feel like the air in my throat is getting higher than it‚Äôs ever gotten before‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still not coming out! I‚Äôve tried twisting my neck and doing shaker exercises and doing the ‚Äúkiss the sky‚Äù stretches and even jumping up and down, but nothing is letting the air out. It eventually gets so uncomfortable (and my hypersalivation is so bad) that I have to swallow, and when I swallow, then it feels like that air bubble goes back down. So is it possible to ruin the Botox by swallowing all the burps instead of letting them out? I‚Äôm so worried that I went through all of this, and it‚Äôs not going to work!!

Title    : Dear emetephobes: don‚Äôt fear the Botox because you don‚Äôt speak the language
Selftext :
I am a lifelong (40sF) r-cpd sufferer with severe emetephobia and I put off Botox for a very long time because of that (and also acid reflux fears). I am now one week post-Botox and it‚Äôs been pretty painful (jaw pain) and I‚Äôm not at the point where I can say if it‚Äôs actually worth it or not. What I can say, though, is that it is blowing my mind how much I did NOT comprehend what a burp actually was or what regurgitation actually was, what all of this stuff was going to actually feel like. None of this is ANYTHING like vomiting. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs like comparing apples and oranges but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more like comparing apples and cats. They literally are not even in the same family. 

Every time I get the burp feeling (which obviously happens a ton now that the Botox is working), I feel immediate panic like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to throw up!‚Äù For the first few days, I would run to the sink or bathroom before I would even try to let it out, because I was so convinced that I was going to vomit. But every time, I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised that it‚Äôs nothing but air. I‚Äôm finally now getting to the point where I‚Äôm still feeling some of that panic, but then calming myself and trusting that it‚Äôs actually only a burp, and I‚Äôm letting them out over carpet. I know I have a long way to go, but I can 100% see how I am going to get used to this and I am going to stop associating that burp feeling with vomiting; it‚Äôs just going to take time and practice.

Then, regurgitation. This was a HUGE fear of mine but the actual experience, while unnerving, has been nothing like I was expecting. It‚Äôs almost like one of those trick candles, where you blow it out and it comes right back on for you to blow out again. It‚Äôs like, you swallow a mouthful, and then you do something stupid (like bend over, or try to force a burp immediately after, or you took too big of a bite to begin with) and then that exact same mouthful magically reappears in your mouth or throat and you just‚Ä¶ swallow it again. There‚Äôs no stomach acid, it‚Äôs not some huge untenable amount, there‚Äôs absolutely no force propelling it out of you, it tastes exactly the same the second time as it did the first time‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs weird, but it‚Äôs nothing like what you are actually afraid of.

I was telling my friend earlier today‚Ä¶ this is kind of like if you had a huge fear of skydiving, and then you‚Äôre in a foreign country and you encounter some people with a plane and a ton of skydiving equipment and they offer to take you on an aerial tour of all the coolest parts of their country. Only‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt speak the language. You have no idea what they‚Äôre saying, but you assume they want you to go skydiving and you just panic and refuse. Everybody keeps trying to tell you what an amazing opportunity this is and all the really cool things you‚Äôll be able to see from up there and how you‚Äôre not in any danger of actually having to do that thing you fear so much‚Ä¶ but again, you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre saying to you. It‚Äôs all gibberish. You just see the equipment and panic and refuse. It‚Äôs totally understandable that you‚Äôd do this, of course, but the only way to get to have this really cool experience is to just hope that these people mean well and get on the plane with them, even though you‚Äôre still not sure that you‚Äôre not going to end up having to jump out of it. Everybody around you knows you‚Äôre in absolutely zero danger of having to face your fear today; you just don‚Äôt get it yet. 



So that‚Äôs my PSA. I‚Äôll report back in a few weeks or months when I see if this burping thing sticks long-term, if the jaw pain goes away, if I enjoyed getting to kick-start my weight loss goals with a slippery mushy diet, if it‚Äôs all worth it in the end for me personally. 



But for now, TLDR: if you‚Äôre only avoiding the procedure because you‚Äôre afraid of throwing up, stop avoiding it. Go into it knowing that you‚Äôre going to be afraid of throwing up post-Botox‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre afraid of throwing up now, so how‚Äôs that any different, really? In the end, you don‚Äôt have to DO the thing you‚Äôre afraid of.*



(*Please don‚Äôt come at me if you get the Botox and then happen to get a stomach bug immediately afterwards.)

Oh agreed, I‚Äôm not sure if I want to burp either, and I‚Äôm actively doing it lol. People who have had the procedure done much longer ago than me will probably give you better advice here, but I will say that what pushed me over the edge here is that as you get older, it only gets worse. I had gurgles and bloating and throat nausea for all of my life and at times it was awful, but most of the time, it was annoying but tolerable. I went to lots of doctors and had lots of tests and they said everything was fine. Even when I finally discovered r-cpd was an actual thing with a possible treatment, I was mostly not interested. Burping does seem kind of gross and I‚Äôd been living with it for this long-why change things now?

But then, in my mid 30s, silent reflux hit. I tried to take meds for it and they all made my R-CPD unmanageable, so I decided to just live with silent reflux. By the time I hit my late 30s, I had a permanent sore throat from untreated silent reflux. It still felt like something I could live with; none of it was excruciating. But I was a little worried about the long-term effects of untreated reflux so I went back for another endoscopy. That test was totally normal 20 years ago, but this time, it showed a hiatial hernia and‚Ä¶ I forget the term for it, but like beginning stage changes to the lining of my throat, where if it continues to advance, you‚Äôll be in danger of getting throat cancer. I did the procedure now so I can try to stop the damage from getting worse. If being able to burp doesn‚Äôt get rid of the reflux, at least I should be able to tolerate going on medicine for reflux. 

If I could go back now to when I first discovered that there was treatment for this, I would get the treatment done then, while I was young, before my body started falling apart from 40-some years of being constantly overloaded with way more gas than the human body was designed to hold.

Hey guys, did anyone do the procedure in Germany and has any experience about it. I called there once and they do this since 2019 and there is a doctor even in Berlin and I want to know if some of you had any experience with the treatment here.

Thank you all for sharing your stories, I really appreciate it. I haven‚Äòt done the procedure yet, because my biggest concern is that somehow my condition will get worse than before. Dealing with this for 24 years, I never enjoyed dinner outside once and I don‚Äòt relate to anything other people do because I always felt different, I am overthinking everything and when I‚Äòm out with friends my mind is never really there. And I think it‚Äòs all because of this condition, (probably most of it is only in my head, after all those years I think it changed my personality, or I stopped somewhere along the way to show my true self, either way). 
But seeing that I am not special makes me happy.
I am definitely doing the botox. And for those who are struggling: try boosting up your mindset with good books, eating healthy and working out. It really helped me AND READING THROUGH THIS SUBREDDIT.
Thanks again for sharing..

The thing is, there is always a reason for vomiting or feeling sick. If you always eat the rights things you won‚Äòt vomit, even if you eat a bit too much. There is a difference between feeling sick because you are ill and feeling sick because of bloating. 
The bloating is due to rcpd, so if you are not bloated anymore you won‚Äòt feel sick and you won‚Äòt vomit.

2 years ago there was a time of 6 month where my no-burp symptoms weren‚Äòt so bad. I worked out and could eat a lot more and I gained like 12-13kg in 6-7 months. But then the bloating got worse and I lost 7-8kg after that. So our no-burp situation is definitely the reason why most of us are skinny.

That is also my main concern, 2 years ago my symptoms got a little better for like 6-7 months. After loosing a lot of weight (180cm with 54kg) I told myself ‚Äûthis needs to stop‚Äú. So I started working out, I woke up early so I could eat 3 meals a day plus a 400-500cal snack. I felt great, although the symptoms weren‚Äòt gone completely, but I boosted up my confidence and the nausea got also better. Because I got so sick and tired of feeling nauseous I told myself ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt care if I throw up‚Äú, with that and together with the work out it got better and I started gaining some weight. 
That‚Äòs when I realized the main reason for me feeling nauseous is because of the fact that I can‚Äòt burp and the rest is in my head. 
And I told myself ‚Äûthere is no reason for me to feel sick when I‚Äòm eating healthy, when I‚Äòm working out, drinking enough etc.‚Äú
But after 7-8 month the symptoms got worse and I‚Äòm struggling again. So I do beleave the no-burping is the main issue.

I guess it could also be related to stress, when you get older you have more responsibility, more things on your mind which causes overthinking and stress. Stress leads to stomach issues for many people in general and in our cases gas build up ist the worst that could happen.

Title    : Does anyone else have this kind of bloating?
Selftext :
Usually the bloating that I have is a big air bubble in my stomache which later on travels to my guts and ends up in flatulence.
But for like a few month that has changed. Now I have like thousands of smaller air bubbles all over my guts, whichs feels a lot worse. I feel more nauseous than with the first type of bloating. 
It also feels like these air bubbles get stuck for a longer time and it also feels more ‚Äûacidy‚Äú if I‚Äòm making any sense. 
I‚Äòm scheduled for botox in august, but I‚Äòm scared that it won‚Äòt fix all of my problems. Fortunately I don‚Äòt have acid reflux, but it seems like my symptoms get worse every month, especially after the stomach flu I got back in october. After that I‚Äòm more nervous whenever I eat something. But than after all the air has left my body (or most of it), I feel totally fine. Maybe some of it is just in my head.

Do you guys also have these upper stomach pain, it‚Äòs like 5-6cm up the belly button. I‚Äòm guessing it could also be the esophagus.

I‚Äòve also been actively gurgling a lot recently trying to control it maybe because of that some acid got into my esophagus.

Same here. I taught myself to burp. It‚Äòs as you described it. I can burp whenever the gurgles start, but I still have all the other symptoms like nausea, bloating etc. But I also feel like most of the air ist not trapped in my esophagus but in my stomach and it won‚Äòt get in my esophagus. Maybe it is because I also have gastritis. So I‚Äòm also thinking if the botox might actually make a difference or not.

So I‚Äòve had my endoscopy recently and it turns out my stomach is almost completely fine aside from a minor gastritis. I don‚Äòt have h.pylori and I also asked them about my upper stomach pain, but my esophagus is also fine. 
My doctor told me that this pain comes with the gastritis that I have, even the back pain at the heigth of my upper stomach is caused by the gastritis apparently. 
But I must say I feel a lot better for the past 3-4 weeks. 
It‚Äòs important to avoid every food that triggers the symptoms, like sugar, white bread, fat.
Oatmeal helps a lot especially for breakfast.

But I still have all the other R-CPD symptoms. So botox is the only solution for me. I can‚Äòt image any other way to fix this. I hope this helps, if you have any questions, I‚Äòm happy to answer them.

I‚Äòve changed my eating habits years ago, so I already knew what food to avoid. They prescribed me the usual pantoprazol. I would recommend camomile tea, mint tea. They help against the acid and the burning pain. Oat meal for breakfast really helps. Doing sports helped alot. And also try to eat smaller portions. People like us with stomach issues can‚Äòt eat big or even normal portions. 
I will start eating smaller portions but more frequently. Let‚Äòs see if that helps, I‚Äòm still trying to figure out the best strategy.

I have the exact same thing. The burps are bigger than microburps and they are like an extension of the gurgles, but still not big enough that I would feel real relief. I can only push the air out that is stuck in my esophagus not the air in my stomach, I‚Äòm still afraid to puke when I push to hard.

Title    : Burping and Spiritual Enlightenment
Selftext :
Burping isn‚Äôt just a social faux pas ‚Äî it‚Äôs a disruption of your body‚Äôs natural energy balance. According to ancient Taoist medicine, each burp expels vital gases like methane and carbon dioxide that are crucial for your spiritual and physical well-being. By suppressing burps, you allow these gases to stay within your body, promoting health, clarity, and even spiritual elevation. 

After being #burpfree for 10 years, I‚Äôve unlocked my third eye, levitated a few inches off the ground, and stopped aging altogether. It‚Äôs been a long journey that feels near impossible at times, but my mind and my body have never been healthier.

Title    : What should I try first?
Selftext :
All of my life I can remember I struggled with burping/never burped, the best I can is sometimes force out the tiniest bubble but it doesn't give relief and make no sound. The only time I've made a burping sound with relief is before throwing up or from extreme nausea when I was trying to throw up

What are the first steps for trying to regain the ability to burp?
I know there's Botox but what do you do first?
I'm seeing my GP tomorrow and looking at getting a referral to ENT Dr Paddle in Melbourne but I'd like to know what to try before Botox and whether it sounds like rcpd or not

My history:
I have emetophobia (vomit phobia)
I get gurgling sounds all the time and always farted a lot.
Suffer from bad bloating and distension that my gastroenterologist hasn't found what's causing it so far. It came up about 5 years ago and is 24/7
I've had a history of chronic pelvic pain and overtight pelvic floor muscles from endometriosis but I've gotten it treated and I'm always working on it
Diagnosed with non corrosive GERD, in otherwords I have acid reflux but no real reason for it so I'm on pantoprazole and told to just use antacids 
Mum said she struggled to get me to burp even as a baby and doesn't remember me burping much as a child just farting a lot

I felt it in my nose cause we found out I have narrow winding nasal cavity so it hurt a bit, but otherwise no struggles. I was worried when swallowing with the camera and had no issues either. And I have a pretty sensitive g*g reflex
You'll be okay, it's worth it. Just if you go under anaesthetic for it just mention to them your phobia and get them to give you an anti nausea as it can make people a bit sick. I've never been sick from it in the past but I have felt pretty terrible and close to, so to ease your fears there's that. Sorry if that scared you more but I thought you'd rather be prepared if you haven't gone under before

Last night I was having lots of small burps after having some soft drink (I've always drank soft drink despite the bloating and gas) which were so weird. I thought I was having micro burps before the procedure but I think these are more microburps

I haven't had that so far even with big pills(day 3 post Botox), but it could be that it just still feels like it's there cause it got stuck. I've had that before prior to Botox. Just keep drinking water normally (not too much or you might make yourself feel sick) and try not to stress about it. If it is still stuck there it'll move on but it's probably just the feeling of it

Day 4 and I'm finally having some real burps. I was starting to get frustrated that I kept having tiny burps and struggling to eat and was worried I wasn't going to burp properly but it's finally started tonight. Been struggling with food getting stuck because i can feel burps happening when trying to eat and the air is kinda fighting against the food going down. Also felt a bit tired in the throat when drinking water and finding I can't take big gulps like I normally would so not drinking quite enough water but it's not bad 
Overall the downsides are just a little frustrating rather than a reason to not do the procedure. Probably actually better for me being forced to actually chew my food, eat slowly and sip water, but it's not what I'm used to

Also having lots of burps while talking but it's been around people I know so they just think it's funny. They're not super loud burps and it's probably my own reaction that makes them noticeable. Had my first few really loud burps while laughing making my loved ones laugh hard while also getting to experience hearing me burp for the first time. My bloat hasn't settled yet so hoping that will happen otherwise I'll be heading back to the gastroenterologist

2 weeks post Botox and definitely a lot less slow swallow, only occassional food is getting a little stuck. Less burps, but having a couple of more big ones now. Still burping a handful of times a day, but that's less than like ten after eating each meal. 
Still getting gurgles. They sometimes turn into burps but not always. Getting a bit of feeling like I need to burp but can't as the burping has become less frequent. Already learnt "how" to burp when I get the feeling but it's not always working now. Hoping things don't disappear completely and that it'll just go to a normal amount of burps.
Still been a bit gassy, but probably a bit less but I think that settled a bit more a few years ago when I became more bloated. Bloat hasn't really settled. Hasn't seemed to get as bad when I drink carbonated stuff and milk but I haven't given it a massive crack yet

The nose scope you won't really feel. They put a numbing spray up your nose which kinda feels like a nasal spray so you'll feel it run down your throat a bit but it's flavoured so it's more of an odd feeling (mine was strawberry) and then it's just pressure up your nose and you don't feel it in your throat at all even when you swallow (I have emetophobia and bad with choking and stuff)

Post Botox and I haven't been sick yet. Even when I've had nausea from other things it hasn't made me sick. And overall I've had less nauseous cause I'm less bloated. Even reflux feels different then being sick. 
And I was worried about being sick when forcing burps or the feeling of burps but I was still able to burp and never was sick. 
Now a month post procedure I've gotten the confidence to force burps with no issue
I have probably more emetophobia than I realised but I'm lucky it hasn't stopped me too much from eating etc. But it might be worth trying to find a phobia psych to get some coping mechanisms for if your fears come true so you can feel better. I've started seeing someone and it's helping with my daily thoughts

7 weeks post Botox update. My bloating/distension has finally gone down and my confidence has raised so much it's gone from a constant 8/10 distention to 2 or 3/10 and a max of 4 even when I eat fatty food or drink something carbonated which used to bring me up to a 9/10 bloat.
I'm burping a lot still but they're a lot quieter burps and I'm getting more confident with actually forcing burps and sometimes I have to do a head turn to get out smaller burps that get a little stuck, but if I was just patient it'd come out normally as a proper burp
Haven't vomited since the procedure but with the confidence from this procedure and some work with a psychotherapist I'm not scared of throwing up anymore, I actually wanted to the other day to get rid of a bunch of phlegm from being sick but decided not to but the thought of it didn't give me anxiety in the slightest. But I am still emetophobic to other people being sick, but I'm going to work on that
So glad I had the procedure and money well spent.

Hi! I'm not sure about ADHD meds straight after. But I wouldn't imagine it would affect it. I think the Botox just does what it does, I don't think anything you can do will stop it from working.

I wouldn't drink things with bubbles right away more because you don't really have the ability to burp right away so it'll probably just cause discomfort until you're burping comfortably. I'd wait a few weeks

As a no burper and suffering with emetephobia (fear with vomiting and gagging) I was wondering about the first tough part with regurgitating, etc. We're you physically being sick or was it more just choking, and was it caused by forcing the air out/trying to burp too much?

After being introduced to r/noburp by a friend, I finally decided to take action and book to see a surgeon who does botox for R-CPD.

I've been putting it off for months now and I'm surprised I've even made it this far, suffering with emetephobia and hearing many scare stories about regurgitation, etc.

None the less, I'm going ahead with high hopes that I'll be lucky enough to miss the sick related stuff, and hopefully the treatment will go well! We've got this guys, and good luck to all those who are looking into getting the botox or going through this nasty no burp reality.

The key is to not overthink as much as possible until you are there, and have committed, because then when you have to face your fear, you will find its not what you imagined it to be :)

Also, burping is not being s*, so once you burp you will realise 'oh its not the thing I thought it would be' if you get what I mean! Hope this helps, I'll be back in a week :))

If you're looking for advice, I've picked up that it's best not to force anything until about a week/until you start getting regular micro-burps, get some acid reflux medicine just in case, some pillows to prop yourself up at night and chill out for the next few days!

Hope all goes well and the botox gives some relief!

Title    : Does singing effect the recovery process after receiving botox?
Selftext :
This is quite specific, but I recently (yesterday) got my botox for R-CPD and my symptoms have been mild to none (some strange burp-like noises when yawing, air-bubble sensation in throat).

What I'm interested to know is if anyone has any idea whether singing negatively effects the recovery process or causes any regurgitation/etc? I sing a lot in my spare time to keep my singing voice strong, however I'm worried doing too much of it might impact my throat. Has anyone else been in a similar situation before or have any advice?

This is a pretty minor problem but I just want to be careful :)

Title    : Still getting gurgles 2 weeks post botox
Selftext :
So I recieved botox treatment around 2 weeks ago and just to give some background info I have had 2 normal burps in total (I have burped a couple times before botox but not often), and I only had 40 units through the injection procedure, rather than 50 units which is what the doctor at the surgery usually gives.

I have been yawning a lot to practice the 'mini-burps', which I can describe as small burps sort of trapped in the throat but it's not gurgling. I've been wondering if this is actually a bad idea though because it feels like I'm swallowing more air than is going out, not sure though...

Tonight and a few nights ago, I have been getting bad gurgling in the throat and feeling pretty sick in general during the evenings after dinner, and I'm confused because I thought getting the botox stops this?

Has anyone else experienced this during the recovery stage and do you have an advice? It's super annoying and I can't get much done without being burdened by them.

Title    : Weird mini burps when yawning (post-botox)
Selftext :
So it's been about 2.5 months since getting botox treatment by injection. 

Things have been going well, I basically never have stomach pains or long periods of bloating anymore, and I can burp after every meal and drink.

The only thing that's been strange (and it's really starting to get on my nerves) is that EVERY time I go to yawn I get these weird mini-burp sounds coming from my throat? And then afterwards, I feel like I have inhaled tons of tons of air into my stomach and it's really uncomfortable.

I don't know maybe this is normal but I've never experienced this before in my life and I keep making frog noises when I yawn! So strange, anyone know what it is or have experience with it?

Thanks for the quick response! I am very interested in getting this done, so I have a few questions if you dont mind.

How long was it until you were able to burp? Did it kick in immediately or did it take a few days?

Has the ability to burp gone away ever? 

Does burping come naturally and automatically or is it a conscious thing you have to do?

and most importantly! Is there a waiting list? How long did it take after contacting her did it take to have her see you? I have had bad experiences in the past with waiting lists.

Title    : Questions for people with Botox
Selftext :
I have a few questions for people who have had the Botox treatment. I am considering it possibly, but I would be interested in hearing how it went for some of you.

1. Do you burp like a normal person? I have heard that some people with the botox treatment burp 'oddly'.
2. (for people with emetophobia) Does it cause regurgitation, and also does it trigger emetophobia?
3. On a scale of 1-10 how bad is the sore throat/recovery process?
4. Did it go away completely after a while? I have seen many people say they needed repeat injections, and I am wondering if anyone has had permanent results 1 year or more after the injections.
5. How difficult is swallowing and eating, and how did you combat that?
6. Is there any exercises i should do after the surgery to improve lasting effect?

Also, feel free to leave any relevant info that I didn't ask about in the comments. I would love to hear what you guys have to say about the surgery's ups and downs, as well as the lasting effects. I am wondering if it is worth it at all if it causes vomiting or emetophobia triggering things.

I get this as well. Does it feel like you almost like swallow the burp down? I have had this my entire life, and I am going to my doctor about it soon. You might want to go to the doctor as well. I know how uncomfortable you feel because I do this daily/have done this for my entire life. Best advice I can give at this point in time is try to take your mind off of it. I know this seems difficult, and it is, but eventually it becomes second nature and you don't even realize you are doing it. Definitely see a doctor when you can though, because you may be able to get a botox injection to allow burping.

Depending on where you live, it may be a good idea to go to a specialist. Personally I am lucky to live near a doctor who is aware of this problem, but i need to get a referral from my GP to see her. If you live in the US and UK, there are a bunch of options to see people who are working as otolaryngologists (people who specialize in these things) to get the surgeries to properly burp and get rid of this swallow issue.

&#x200B;

I am surprised your doctor is not aware of botox injections. Perhaps he is not very familiar with gastro problems, as people who have difficulty swallowing get this procedure done very often. Consider switching your doctor all together (unless you have found this is a one off).

&#x200B;

I totally understand if you don't want to say, but if you can tell me the country you live in, I know of a few specialists around the world. Or you can look them up yourself. Canada, US, UK, are all places that I am aware have people who provide this surgery.

Do you mind telling me some stuff about how severe it was before the surgery? Did you experience pain due to pressure or was it more of a discomfort? Also this is a weird thing to ask but did it improve your 'farting' frequency? Lol I only ask that because for me it is one of the major reasons I feel I need the surgery.

Since this is something still relatively unknown to most doctors, seeing someone who is familiar with this issue is important.

I don't experience it often, but I actually am having hiccups currently. I have the best solution. This has worked every single time without fail for me, so hopefully this helps get rid of them. 

&#x200B;

Sit on a chair, and lean down so that your stomach is lower than your esophagus.  

like this:

&#x200B;

|\_ this is normal position with the back straight on the chair

&#x200B;

/\_ this is kind of what you should be doing, but even more extreme. Like, basically put your chin to your knees kind of thing. 

Then, drink water in this position. You will not throw up, but you kind of trick your esophagus to not hiccup. Once the water is swallowed, stay in the position for a few seconds, and when you think its down, come back up into a normal sitting position and relax. If the hiccups are back, try drinking more water than the first time, swallow slower, and stay in a low position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is a video I found that is a bit easier to understand because its kind of hard to explain what to do.

My parents used to complain about how I ate like a bird, but after like five bites, I would feel way too full to even try another bite. I would always feel sick after eating, and often ate about 2 small/regular sized meals a day. I also have terrible stomach pains after meals, because of gas issues from the inability to burp.

‚Äã

Basically, do you guys experience problems with eating, or is this unrelated to noburp?

One method that helps me is just not eating for a while. I listen closely to my body, and only eat when I think it wont hurt my stomach. Sometimes this is in an hour, and other times its in a day. it has been a wonderful way (for me personally) to get the gas to come out on its own. Obviously eat when you begin to not feel the pressure, but don't force yourself when you feel sick.

I cant burp, but I dont experience this issue. Perhaps you have so much gas in your esophagus, that swallowing kind of 'pushes' the air back down, creating a sound? Like, if you think of a pressurized tube, and then someone begins adding things into the tube, because of the air pressure, it requires more force to swallow?

Ah well i mentally can't force myself to throw up air, so I'm probably going to opt for the surgery. This is mainly because i only feel really sick right after I eat, and i fear that my induced burping will bring up more than air...

Title    : Method for burping!
Selftext :
To start this off, I have not burped ONCE in my entire life. Not even accidentally, so I hope this inspires you to not give up. I found a way to burp, but it doesn't make a noise whatsoever. I definitely feel extreme relief and I hope it works for someone. I never thought I'd burp without the surgery, so this is fantastic.

‚Äã

Step 1: When you feel an air bubble come up, relax your throat, almost like saying "ahhh" at the doctors office, except don't make any noise. Relax it to an extreme, and then a bit more. Your jaw should be loose, and your  mouth should be open.

‚Äã

Step 2: Take a medium sized breath, and hold it. Wait until you feel the air rising up before you go to this step.

‚Äã

Step 3: When you feel the air 'knocking at the door', exhale the breath you've been holding. Do this while keeping the throat very relaxed. It will take time to practice the timing of this, but you will immediately know when it works, because the relief will be fantastic. The exhale should not be forceful, but kind of relaxed as well. 

‚Äã

The exhaling part was the final step in me being able to burp. 

‚Äã

Some final notes as to why it worked.

‚Äã

\-I have been taking CBD for the past while, but I don't know if this was something that affected it or not.

\-I have been doing exercises for people with dysphagia, like shaker, and a different one where you swallow while your tongue is between your teeth.

\-I have been concentrating on how my body feels directly before the air goes back down, and paying attention to what helps it move further up.

‚Äã

I recommend sitting in a back up position, and being patient with yourself, as a major part of it is being very relaxed.

YEP that is what I felt. You have to trust yourself enough to know that your body will take care of you. I seriously can't explain how good it felt afterwards. Please don't give up! I promise it is worth a try! Maybe watch a movie you enjoy or read a book that helps you. Even listen to a relaxing song, and know that you are safe and your body will feel SO good after. I used to 'swallow' the air back down, but now that I know how to release it, I feel fantastic!!

I have 100% belief that it is possible without surgery, as I seriously thought I'd never get it down, yet here we are! If you are feeling a neck cramp, then you are not doing this method correctly. If it hurts and feels tight, I think you should take a day off and try again when it feels better. This method works the best when your throat is very loose and relaxed. Focus on exhaling with a relaxed throat, and remember to be gentle with yourself when learning. It can be very frustrating when you feel so close, and then no burp ever comes. That was exactly how I felt, until I decided to try a different throat position where it was less forceful, and more of a loose, open position. Your throat might hurt from overexertion, which means that you may be inadvertently tightening the exact part of your body that needs to be loosened. 

&#x200B;

I am sure that it may be much easier for people to do the surgery route, and if you do end up choosing that road, then don't feel bad! Just remember that even once you book the surgery, keep trying different methods and see which one works the best. In my opinion, exhaling once you feel the air rise up with a relaxed throat seems to be the easiest for me, but that doesn't mean it's the easiest for you. Though if you feel like you are close, then you are on the right track.

&#x200B;

Good luck!

This is anecdotal, but i never burped as an infant. I had a distended stomach, and the only times I ever burped was when I would throw up. Obviously a baby doesn‚Äôt have emetophobia so it makes me think that it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm just born with, and the emetophobia came later. I recommend asking your parents if you burped as a baby.

Title    : Guinness beer is drinkable
Selftext :
For anyone who can‚Äôt burp, you will know how carbonation messes you up. Guinness beer has a different type of carbonation and it is very easy to drink. It isnt carbonated. Its nitrogenated. The bubbles are very small and it doesnt cause the gurgles or pain in your esophagus. Obviously ymmv but for me its a really good choice because it‚Äôs available at most restaurants/bars, and is very tasty. 

Give it a try and let me know if you also find it to be a good beer option!

I am mildly hypermobile as well, and I‚Äôm also an occupational therapist. What I know about hypermobility is the syndrome of tight muscles overcompensating for weak muscles and unstable joints. For every chronically tight muscle, there is one or more weak muscles that need to be strengthened. This can indeed affect the entire body and lead to abnormal movement patterns, as well as overuse of certain muscle groups for stability.

One thing that I constantly notice in myself is the overuse of my upper abdominals for core stability, as well as holding my breath and keeping those upper abdominals sucked in most of the time.

This is where I‚Äôd need to dive deeper, but it would make sense that the diaphragm and normal breathing patterns would be affected by this, which would affect the LES (increased pressure), which may result in hypertonicity of the UES. 

Hypermobile folks also tend to have increased cervical kyphosis (forward head), which I‚Äôm thinking might also play some kind of role. I did go down a rabbit hole the other day and read about cervical misalignment and how it can affect vagus nerve function (which controls the involuntary smooth muscle of the sphincters among a billion other things). 

Definitely room for more research, for sure!

Title    : So excited by all of the progress!
Selftext :
Hey everyone, I used to post all the time on this subreddit back in 2015/2016, under the username of snowyshroom. I was deep in the rabbit hole of no-burping and collecting as much data as I could from others to try and find commonalities among us and understand wtf this was. It was very frustrating that there were so many of us, yet such little information.

Well, I moved out of state in 2016 and quickly became focused on other things. I gave up on whatever mission I was on and ended up deleting Reddit altogether, and forgetting my password :)

A few months ago, I randomly decided to do a Google search about no burp‚Ä¶.and IT HAD A NAME! And a TREATMENT! And there was new research other than a case study from the 80s! And this group was credited in it!

Y‚Äôall, I was so elated. I was promptly inspired to make an appointment with my PCP and start talking about this. Thankfully she was a resident at the hospital where I work (as an occupational therapist) and knows I‚Äôm not insane. I got referred to GI, who DID kinda look at me like I was insane, but whatever. I had an esophageal manometry study a few weeks ago and will have an EGD next week. I only agreed to these studies because I‚Äôve been having worsening reflux over the past few years (manometry confirmed GERD) and want to know about the condition of my LES and esophageal lining. As far as finding someone to address my R-CPD, my GI doc literally said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to help you with that, you‚Äôll have to find somebody on your own‚Äù. Cool thanks.

I live in Tacoma, WA and found Dr. Craig Villari, an ENT in Bellevue, on the list in this subreddit (thank you!!). I followed up with my PCP, who actually helped me and put a referral in. I see him on 4/22!

Phew. What a journey. I just want to congratulate and thank everyone for their work, insights, and diligence. It seems that we would have not have made any progress had it not been for this subreddit! It‚Äôs been very informative reading about everyone‚Äôs Botox experiences and seeing continued discussions about other traits we share that could potentially give insight into underlying causes of R-CPD. Keep it up!

Title    : Post-Botox report and random LES question
Selftext :
Hey all,

I‚Äôm 6 days post-Botox and haven‚Äôt had much happen yet. By mid-day I‚Äôm still gurgly, bloated, and gassy as hell. I think I might (??) be microburping but honestly I still find it very difficult to tell despite what I‚Äôve been reading here. Some feel like the usual gurgles but are louder, and others feel like tiny little ‚Äúurps‚Äù that feel kind of different. However, not once have I tasted anything so I just don‚Äôt freaking know. Oftentimes I feel the pressure at my UES like something definitely wants to come out, but it feels like there isn‚Äôt quite enough upward force or momentum. It‚Äôs like getting close to an orgasm but never getting there lol. So frustrating! I‚Äôm getting impatient!

After reading through dozens of reports that vary quite a bit, I‚Äôve been wondering if the LES has anything to do with post-Botox results. For instance, I had an EGD in April that showed that my LES is ‚Äúflaccid‚Äù and ‚Äúgaping‚Äù. I also know that my esophageal motility is not normal per my manometry results.

So, assuming that my LES is still ‚Äúgaping‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt that affect pressure dynamics through the esophagus? Wouldn‚Äôt upward movement of air behave differently with an LES that opens then shuts, vs staying open? Could my progress be slower because I have to wait until my LES gains more tone (and that would rely on less bloating)?

Before anyone asks, yes I‚Äôve been doing the head turns, chin tucks, inhaling, relaxing and letting it happen, etc. 

So, who here knows about their LES function at the time of Botox? If so, what was the status, and what was your progress like post-Botox?

Reading through all of these variable post-Botox reports is making me wonder if the condition of one‚Äôs LES prior to Botox may have anything to do with speed of results.

So with air that enters our body through our esophagus, I‚Äôm guessing that gas exchange doesn‚Äôt happen and that O2 (and the other gases in air) might be in our intestines. Unless there‚Äôs some kind of O2 permeation going on in our viscera which I‚Äôm not sure about. 

But then you have the stomach acid and bacteria in the GI tract too, with gases like methane being released by the bacteria. 

I think the simple answer is that it‚Äôs just plain old air, and probably not CO2 because that‚Äôs a toxic waste product that is created via metabolic processes and gas exchange.

That‚Äôs generally beyond my scope of expertise, but I have read many times about how bacteria levels and gases can be thrown off in the setting of GI issues. 

Our bodies don‚Äôt make bacteria, they all come from an outside source. Some are good for us and others aren‚Äôt (like E. Coli, MRSA, etc). It‚Äôs bacteria that produces gasses like methane and hydrogen, though. So if there‚Äôs an imbalance of bacteria in your gut and your stomach acid isn‚Äôt sufficient in killing them off, then you‚Äôll have more methane and other gasses in your gut. And yes, they can come out in your exhalations because they‚Äôre also metabolic waste products like CO2.

I hope that helps, my knowledge on that is limited!

I had Botox 10 days ago and it‚Äôs going pretty smoothly so far! I have been on Omeprazole and taking Reflux Gourmet since my EGD so I think that helped calm the inflammation down before my Botox. My intra-operative photos look WAY better than the ones from my EGD. 

Since Botox, I‚Äôve been able to feel more of what‚Äôs going on in my esophagus from a pressure dynamics standpoint. I‚Äôm feeling the tone in the muscles around my esophagus change gradually from day to day. I think my LES tone might be gradually normalizing. I‚Äôm understanding why it takes a while! It‚Äôs wild.

I‚Äôm 39 and got Botox 10 days ago.

I‚Äôve been unable to burp for as long as I can remember. I recall telling my friends and family about it at a very early age, explaining why I didn‚Äôt like to drink soda. 

I vomited about once a year up until the age of 10, which was the very last time. They were all traumatic experiences and I am emetophobic as well.  

I started getting consistently croaky/gurgly around the age of 22. I first developed reflux around age 24-25, but only when I was upside down or bending over. 

Over the last 10-15 years, my bloating, croaking, and GI issues got progressively worse. I was on this sub back in 2015/2016 looking for answers before we had any. I eventually lost hope and just kinda went on with my life.

Fast-forward to earlier this year. My GERD was terrible, giving me problems at all times of the day. My mom got diagnosed with achalasia and had to get surgery. I work in the medical field and see way too many horrible cases involving the esophagus, so I decided to take action and address my GERD before things got worse. I decided to go to my PCP and get a GI consult. I had been putting the pieces together regarding no-burp and GI issues for a long while in my head, and knowing I was probably gonna get gaslighted about my no-burp by the GI specialist, I decided to hit Google again and see if there was anything new about it. 

My jaw dropped when I saw that no-burp now had an official name/diagnosis AND treatment. 

Using the advantage of my medical knowledge, I directed my own care and chose an EGD and manometry study out of the numerous tests the GI doc (who didn‚Äôt know how to help me with R-CPD) proposed to me. I chose to have these done because I wanted to know of the condition of my esophagus and start whatever meds I needed to calm the GERD down, and I wanted to know about the pressure dynamics and motility of my esophagus. The results of these tests helped me gain a better understanding of the big picture. 

Despite me telling the GI doc about the ENT I found near me who would do Botox, he didn‚Äôt bother writing a referral and just left it all up to me. So I went back to my PCP and she wrote the referral right away üôÑ

I had Botox on 8/23, and my first real burp was 2 days ago! 

I am very in tune with my body and I‚Äôm sensing quite a few subtle changes in BOTH esophageal sphincters, my larynx and trachea, my neck muscles, my diaphragm, my tongue, etc. It‚Äôs WILD. The Botox is literally facilitating neuromuscular re-education (same thing that occurs with stroke survivors during rehabilitation!). 

Thanks for reading if you did, that was long :)

Every day has been different! I‚Äôve discovered that it has a lot to do with what I‚Äôm doing that day, whether it be talking all day, briskly walking uphill, sitting around, etc. 

The first few days were very gurgly and gassy, but that started easing up a few days ago. I‚Äôve only had one real burp, but I‚Äôm also not as gurgly or bloated these past few days. However I did feel kinda nauseated with low appetite today. 

It kinda makes sense when you consider all the changes and adjustments going on in there. 

I also realized that not all burps or releases of air are gonna make noise or taste like anything. I think air is just supposed to escape silently throughout the day without you even noticing. I think there‚Äôs a lot more of that happening with me so far.

Title    : I‚Äôm having a hard time :(
Selftext :
I‚Äôm about 4 weeks post-Botox (50 units). I had ONE really good burp about 1 week in, which was making me feel very optimistic, but I‚Äôve had nothing more than the same annoying gurgles and some small microburps since then, no matter what I do (and I‚Äôm doing all the things). I was feeling a big better over the first 2 weeks in general, but now I‚Äôm actually having way more nausea than I did before surgery, and it‚Äôs kinda hard to eat very much. 

One thing I did recently do that might be contributing to my current symptoms is that I stopped taking my Omeprazole in the morning (still taking it at night), just out of curiosity. But I suppose my body might be telling me it‚Äôs not ready for that yet. So I guess I‚Äôll stop skipping my morning dose and see how it goes. I just wanna get off that med ASAP, given its long-term side effects. 

Any similar experiences or insights?

Anxiety and the autonomic nervous system definitely affect the GI system. When we‚Äôre anxious, our sympathetic nervous system kicks in, which usually triggers a release of bodily fluids/contents (part of the fight or flight response). Digestion usually gets put on pause so that blood flow can be prioritized for our muscles and brain. We also clench our muscles more (ESPECIALLY those in the jaw, neck, and upper thorax), which are probably connected to upper esophageal function, breathing, vagus nerve function, and vasovagal responses. 

So I think your symptoms make a lot of sense given the severe stress and anxiety you‚Äôre experiencing.

You could try looking up some ways to calm the vagus nerve and activate the parasympathetic nervous system before bed. One very easy thing to do is simply performing some diaphragmatic/belly breathing. 

Good luck!

Whoa, take a deep breath. 

-Intubation is a pretty invasive thing, and some peoples‚Äô anatomy makes it extra difficult. There‚Äôs a reason why they sedate you before they do it. It is very common for people to get cuts and scrapes around and inside their mouth during the process. I work in a hospital and there‚Äôs a big reason why we don‚Äôt want people intubated for very long; it can quickly cause dysphagia, skin breakdown, and sores after a couple of days. If you‚Äôre not too squeamish, you might want to search for videos of the intubation process on YouTube or something. 

-It‚Äôs also fairly common for some people to need extra anesthesia to go fully under, for various reasons. 

-I didn‚Äôt see my doctor after my procedure either. With a quick procedure like that, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too common for the doctor to come talk to you afterwards unless there was some kind of significant finding or complication (such as, ‚Äúwe weren‚Äôt able to deliver the injection‚Äù). It‚Äôs pretty common practice for them to talk to your driver about stuff like cutting your lip, because you‚Äôre still coming off sedation and might be a little too loopy. In the hospital, even people with major orthopedic trauma who have huge long surgeries don‚Äôt see the surgeon again until sometime the next day. Surgeons and doctors are super busy; yours could have had another procedure to attend to right after yours. 

-24 hours is not enough time to evaluate how it‚Äôs going for you! I completely understand the anxiety about wasting your money on something that doesn‚Äôt work. But you have a long road ahead of you. I‚Äôm almost a month out and it‚Äôs been kind of up and down for me. I even made a post a few hours ago about having a hard time. But I‚Äôm really trying to just relax and understand that I‚Äôm waiting for my body to unlearn nearly 40 years‚Äô worth of abnormal patterns.

Title    : Who else thinks SLPs/OTs/PTs should be in on this?
Selftext :
I‚Äôm an OT, and with all of the posts I see here about people having no idea how to burp after Botox (myself included), I keep thinking that this sounds like a new specialization opportunity for the rehab disciplines. I honestly feel like each discipline could bring something useful to the table. There‚Äôs so much neuromuscular reeducation that needs to happen during this process, and I think it would help increase the success rate if we went to see a therapist after Botox instead of just having to figure it out ourselves. 

Who‚Äôs with me on this? Or does anyone know of this happening anywhere already?

I have no idea how it would all come to be, but I definitely have a strong feeling that it would start in the field of Speech Therapy.

I think there is more to be discovered in other parts of the body besides the neck/throat and how they contribute to RCPD. I suspect that pelvic tilt and pelvic floor is involved, which affects positioning of the diaphragm and stomach. I think core strength as a lot to do with it. As well as breathing patterns, posture, and anxiety. I see potential for a lot of hip girdle, pelvic floor, and core strengthening, stretching, biofeedback methods, postural re-training, manual visceral manipulation, bodily awareness, breathing techniques, and anxiety management that could be done for this, which would be offered by OT and PT in addition to interventions focused on the throat via ST. We‚Äôre not there yet but I can totally see it happening in the future as we learn more about how the rest of the body is involved with this diagnosis.

Well, I don‚Äôt observe surgeries or procedures (I‚Äôm an occupational therapist), but what it sounds like is that the needle is attached to the end of the scope that goes down the esophagus. The scope also has a camera on it so they can see what they‚Äôre doing. The endotracheal/breathing tube goes down your trachea, which is right in front of the esophagus.  So you have one tube going down your trachea in front, and another, smaller tube/scope going down your esophagus, right behind it. I imagine it to be a pretty cramped situation, but it‚Äôs rather quick.

I think prior to even doing a study like that, we need to do a systematic review on how one‚Äôs neck musculature, posture, anatomy, autonomic nervous system,  psyche, etc affect burping and R-CPD. Then there needs to be a review of evidence-based interventions to address each issue and figure out what‚Äôs still missing. Maybe these have already been done, I‚Äôm not sure tbh. Right now I feel like there are lots of unanswered or unasked questions about this disorder that need to be explored.

Thanks for your input! I was thinking they could approach it from a postural alignment standpoint, IF future research shows that it‚Äôs a significant factor in all of this.

Realistically, it would probably have to come from a university or research hospital where ENTs and therapists have a strong working relationship. Or from a ST/OT/PT doctorate student who has R-CPD or is very familiar with it. Most medical professionals still have no idea it exists at this point.

I‚Äôve been trying so many things, including inhaling and holding my breath. The diaphragm definitely plays a role in pushing air upward. So far this has always triggered movement of air, but it usually feels like it hits the UES then pops or dissipates instead of exiting. I‚Äôve probably not been pulling my chest inward though, so I‚Äôll experiment with that today. I definitely have to correct my posture and ‚Äúclose my ribs‚Äù on a frequent basis during everyday movement and it‚Äôs easy for me to forget about it when I‚Äôm focusing on something else.

I will say I‚Äôve been a little weary of doing maneuvers as I‚Äôve been reading on here that you‚Äôre not really supposed to do that and that it‚Äôs just supposed to come up on its own. So I‚Äôve been focusing mostly on identifying what muscles are tensing up when I feel a burp coming up and just trying to relax those (it‚Äôs all in my neck, chest, and upper abs). But most of the time, it feels like there just isn‚Äôt enough upward force or momentum for it to push its way through the UES. So what you said makes a lot of sense.

I forgot to say that the scope for the esophagus goes through your nose. I would assume that it‚Äôs pretty small in diameter if it‚Äôs going through your nasal passage. So it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre shoving a huge tube into your esophagus. Both tubes are made to be slightly smaller in diameter than what they‚Äôre entering, probably with the goal of preventing or minimizing damage.

Title    : This has been discussed a million times here, but GERD tho
Selftext :
I feel like a dog chasing its tail. 

I‚Äôm now 4 months post-Botox. I had a real burp ONCE this whole time. All other times have been maybe microburps vs burps that couldn‚Äôt escape. It‚Äôs been very difficult to tell because they do feel a bit stronger, but I NEVER taste anything and I don‚Äôt feel any relief. 

I‚Äôve concluded that I likely need a second round, possibly at a higher dose. It feels like it worked a little bit, but not quite enough to allow true burps. 

Here‚Äôs my conundrum though: I‚Äôm still getting relentless croaks and gurgles like I did before Botox. They always start after I‚Äôve spent a few hours running around and talking to patients, during which I know I‚Äôm probably gulping in a ton of air. As soon as I sit down to document, they start and will NOT stop. Before Botox, it always felt like the gurgles were gas bubbles trying over and over again to escape. But now, it‚Äôs feeling more like it‚Äôs GERD-related. Like gas constantly bubbling up through my LES‚Äîwhich I know for a fact is too relaxed and gaping open‚Äîand maybe or maybe not exiting through my UES. 

Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is that it seems like I‚Äôm experiencing something like the excessive belching that is often seen with GERD. Something that might be more GERD-related than R-CPD related. Like I‚Äôm just producing way too much acid and gas and my floppy LES is just letting it all through. 

So‚Ä¶even if I get Botox again and it works‚Ä¶is this fucking gurgling EVER gonna stop? Do I need a Nissen or something? 

Yes, I take Omeprazole 2x/day. No, I don‚Äôt experience heartburn when I‚Äôm on it, but if I ever stop taking it, it‚Äôs horrible.

Maybe I am, but it also seems unknown whether an LES in that condition is able to tighten back up or if it‚Äôs gonna be permanent. To my knowledge, there‚Äôs not enough data on that yet. Let‚Äôs say my LES remains the way it is. Even if my UES normalizes after more Botox, how do we know I won‚Äôt continue having issues with a permanently abnormal LES? 

A few months ago I posted on here asking how many people knew the condition of their LES or as a result of EGD and/or manometry, as I was curious if there was any correlation with success after Botox. I didn‚Äôt get many responses and most people who answered didn‚Äôt know. And when I brought it up with my GI doc, he just shrugged his shoulders. So that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm feeling this way!

But yeah, I‚Äôm definitely gonna give Botox another go, already talked to my ENT about that.

Don‚Äôt let me make you panic lol. But, the times I haven‚Äôt v*, it has been worth it because the air actually comes out. It‚Äôs just scary to try. Because, one time I did (tw here), and v* came through my nose and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe which then caused me to panic and pass out 3 times in a row. Most of the time though, I can tell when my body can handle forcing the air out or not. If I have an acidic feeling in my stomach or if I just ate, I won‚Äôt do it. I can typically feel if my previously eaten food has digested enough to try to relieve myself or not. Usually I try to expel the air in the morning when brushing my teeth (if I didn‚Äôt eat too late the night before), because my stomach is basically empty and, if I don‚Äôt, I go through the day feeling nauseous.

Hi LoL. I can‚Äôt speak for those who have had Botox, but the nausea, oh yeah. I wake up nauseous almost every morning and if any air is trapped during the day, that‚Äôll make me nauseous as well. My only relief is air vomiting. Basically gagging myself until I get any air out, but that can be risky because a couple times I have actually thrown up and it‚Äôs no fun üôÉüôÉüôÉ

Title    : Air vomiting and anxiety
Selftext :
So, not sure if this is just me. The last 2-3 weeks, my anxiety was SUPER high. I noticed the first week, when I would try to air vomit, it felt like I couldn‚Äôt. When I would try, I was hardly able to get any air out (Usually I‚Äôm able to get quite a bit out). It felt like the muscles in my throat would NOT relax and the trapped air just kept making me feel miserable. Today I guess I‚Äôm not so anxious, because I was finally able to get SO much air out. It was even painful a couple times because of the force/speed that the air came out. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like that? The anxiety, or anything, making the muscles in your throat feel more tense than usual making it harder to air vomit. Also the chest pain from the force of the air.

Title    : How to get botox/what to expect?
Selftext :
I‚Äôve had this problem since i was 14. I‚Äôm tired of gagging myself almost everyday and being forced to do so in university bathrooms and restaurants. Had a gastro procedure and am waiting for my follow up at the end of december. I already know they‚Äôre going to say it‚Äôs GERD. Perhaps the rcpd is causing the gerd idk. I was wondering how to find someone to do botox? I‚Äôm on medicaid and have doctors who never remember my name even though i‚Äôve been going there for 20 years since i was 3 days old. So everytime i go in they haven‚Äôt done any research or measures to help me with my problem. Does anyone with medicaid know if they‚Äôll cover botox and a proper doctor? I‚Äôm also worried about what to exocet post op. thanks :)

So for those of you who have had the botox procedure, what should i do/not do? what should i expect shortly after procedure? what should i expect in the long term? anything to ask my doctor pre op or post op?, did it make it better? Did it make it worse? Any and every experience is greatly appreciated thanks!!!

Title    : 3 Days Post Botox 
Selftext :
On day 2 I started burping. Some are very small and others are long but all of them take a bit of effort to get out. I will say that 80% of my burps don't feel like they fully relieve me and feel similar to the gurgles I experienced prior to procedure. However, they do feel more relieving then when it would just gurgle inside. 

Slow swallow is the WORST. I know it will go away but in the meantime I get nauseous when the food feels stuck. 

Lots of air still getting stuck. I can hear it gurgle when i take a deep breath in but as i try to push it out it gets stuck. I am slowly learning news ways to get out the stuck air. 

I need to burp after every sip of water and when I blow my nose. Not sure the connection with nose blowing and burping.

Title    : 1 MONTH POST OP 
Selftext :
UPDATE: 1 Month later

I can burp!!!

Symptoms that I no longer have:
-Gurgling 
-Stuck air 
-bloating 
-the need to gag myself to burp
-Always farting

New symptoms post op: 
-hardly any gag reflux 
-frequently throw up in my mouth/in my throat. Not a full blown throw up and it just goes back down my throat. It happens more when i'm laying down and trying to burp or laying down and drink water. also happens sometimes if i choke on something such as spit or water. 
-extremely frequent burps

Slow swallow pretty much went away after 2 weeks. I still sometimes have a minor slow swallow if I try and eat too fast or too big of bites. Swallowing water helps.

The first couple weeks it took soo much effort to get small burps out. 6/10 burps felt like they relieved air and pressure. The rest felt unproductive and similar to gurgles. Another symptoms hard to have was the CONSTANT need to burp. Wether i ate, drank, swallowed or none of those, i always needed to burp but couldn't always get it out. Twice i tried to gag myself like i would pre op but my gag reflux is non existent now so it didn't work and made me anxious that I wouldn't be able to get it out. I had to just relax and wait a few minutes and try again. I don't really have this issue anymore.

My burps have consistently gotten better, bigger, and easier. I burp all the time. Probably every 10-15 minutes the first couple weeks. Now I burp less but definitely way more then the average person. They're usually quieter and not really noticeable by others. I can't say wether they're "normal" because i've never had a normal burp before. About 60% of them don't sound extremely normal and are a deep growl sound. The rest sound like a regular burp. It's usually easier for me to burp with my mouth closed. Not sure why haha. Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get it out. It also sometimes feels like I can't get it all the way out/ that I literally need to chronically burp. However, that was more intense the first couple weeks and has decreased since then.

DONT BE EMBARRASSED!!!! Tell your co workers that you frequently work with about your inability to burp. Chances are they will laugh. Then tell them about your procedure and warn them you will be burping a lot. When i told my co workers about how hard it truly was, they feel excited for me when I burp too! If you must mention it to them just be honest. However, don't say anything if you don't care. It's way more socially acceptable then farting so you should just burp with confidence lol.

Overall, GET THE SURGERY!!! I will probabaly have to get one more botox procedure at a higher dosage eventually but it's sooooo worth it!

Most of my burps are involuntary, but I also learned in the first few days that if I sat up at roughly a 60 degree angle in bed (which naturally puts pressure on the stomach) and sucked inward with my throat (like a more intense version of making throat noises with mouth closed), I‚Äôd trigger burps. I think it‚Äôs most effective when you‚Äôre feeling discomfort.

Got Botox procedure 3.5 weeks ago. Changed my life. No more gurgles, I can eat and drink anything (except super spicy, but I think that will come around).

Title    : 14 weeks post-Botox: burping but also reflux
Selftext :
Hey everyone,

After many years of going down the GERD treatment path, but getting no relief for the gurgle burps, I discovered this group. In September I had a successful Botox injection, and I now burp all the time (hooray!). Additionally, flatulence is way down, and my ‚Äúpregnant‚Äù look has all but disappeared.

However, now 14 weeks post-procedure, it seems like I experience reflux more intensely. I‚Äôve noticed that it happens almost every night when sleeping. Even with elevated pillow, lying on left side, not eating/drinking late, reflux meds, I wake up with a sore throat. And doing physical things I used to do like pushups and crunches results in a rush of stomach juices up my esophagus - which I don‚Äôt ever remember experiencing pre-procedure. 

Has anyone had this reflux post-procedure and seen it fade, and/or figured out a long-term solution for night reflux? 

Thanks!

Before the procedure, I definitely had reflux:

1) Esophagitis was rated a ‚ÄúB‚Äù
2) Bravo pH monitor identified that I suffered from regurgitation at night
3) I experienced mysterious gum recession

I‚Äôm inclined to say that my reflux has not actually changed much since before the procedure. The big noticeable change is that my upper esophageal sphincter opens up more easily day-to-day when I‚Äôm regurgitating.

I think that I used to focus more on the r-CPD symptoms even while I experienced actual reflux. 

But in terms of the issue of regurgitation with push-ups and crunches, I‚Äôve resumed doing them, mostly in the morning, and I‚Äôve been okay. So maybe there‚Äôs some improvement there.

Title    : Had GERD and rCPD; GERD got worse after Botox
Selftext :
Hi all!

Just wanted to give you a heads up, and ask a few questions. I‚Äôm male, 35 years old.

Before I discovered my rCPD, I determined through endoscopies that I had GERD and a hiatal hernia. Had some esophageal damage but nothing too severe. I also had a mysterious case of rapid gum recession that didn‚Äôt make sense given my diligent oral hygiene routine, until I realized that I was regurgitating acid in the middle of the night. 

After receiving Botox, my rCPD symptoms, which were most impacting my quality of life, were completely gone. I could now eat enjoyably without hours of gurgle burps to follow.

However, my regurgitation has gotten worse, and travels further up the esophagus now. I did a bravo pH monitoring study for 3 days and experienced some pretty intense reflux on 1-2 of the days, so now I take daily PPIs with Gaviscon Advance.

I consulted with a GI doc about getting a stomach wrap surgery. She said that I don‚Äôt need to do it now, but that given my age it‚Äôs almost inevitable that I‚Äôll need to do it, once the PPIs stop working.

It‚Äôs hard to tell if I ensured this reality by getting the Botox, but absolutely 0 regrets for the quality of life increase. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, I did have some esophageal damage and gum recession even before Botox, which would indicate the problem was always there.

Has anyone else here had GERD from the time of being relatively young, and if so, how have you managed? Have you had success with any of the alternative approaches to combating GERD (apple cider vinegar, HCl pills, probiotics, etc)? It would be nice to not have to wrap my stomach‚Ä¶

But there‚Äôs definitely some room to explore with diet. The challenge is that I can‚Äôt always tell if I‚Äôm experiencing reflux - mine is relatively subtle. I was surprised with the pH monitor that some of what I thought were just normal burps also brought acid with them‚Ä¶

Da Hamburg eine ordentliche Strecke von mir entfernt ist war mein Plan eig. anzufragen, ob ich die Voruntersuchung und den Eingriff auf 2 aufeinanderfolgende Tage legen kann. 
Damit h√§tte sich die Option des vorherigen Einreichens eines Berichts aber ja erledigt.
Lohnt es sich √ºberhaupt f√ºr einen Bericht weit im Voraus dort aufzutauchen oder gehen die √úbernahmechancen der Kosten gegen 0?
Gibt es ggf. eine andere M√∂glichkeit an so eine Bescheinigung zu kommen? 
Oder eine andere M√∂glichkeit die Kosten (wenigstens anteilweise) erstattet zu bekommen? Wenn nicht von der Krankenkasse, dann vielleicht von der Steuer? 

Ich bin sehr dankbar √ºber eure Hilfe.
Habt einen beschwerdefreien Tag. üòä

Title    : Scared of side effects
Selftext :
Hey friends.

I'm about to book my appointment for Botox any day now. All that is keeping me from it is my terrible fear of the side effects. Especially the vomitting many people talk about and the laryngospasm (can you die from it?). Could you please tell me if you had any of these, how bad they were, what else you might have experienced and if it all went away? How long did the side effects last? 

I booked a few trips with friends and family this years (all about 6 to 8 weeks apart). Should I ask for an appointment right after a trip so that I have 6 weeks at home? I'm a worrier, sorry.üòî

If you travelled far for the appointment, did you leave right after the treatment or stay one more night close to the clinic? Did you go to your normal doctor with side effects?

Thanks in advance!

Title    : Tension in the neck area
Selftext :
Hello fellow no burpers!

I'm getting my botox treatment in summer.

Before I found this group though I visited a doctor that told me that issues with swallowing etc often come from a lot of tension in the neck area.
I have had a lot of it all my life (to the point where a therapist told my mom when I was a child that he had never seen someone my age with that much tension). I also suffer from TMJ and wanted to ask if any of you have realized any connections?

When I was a baby my burping was just fine, so now I wonder if rcpd came from being tense? If that's the case I'm worried about the effect of the procedure once the botox wears off.

I've done a lot of physical therapy etc pp but cannot really get rid of that tense neck/jaw.

Please let me know what you think.

Thank you!

Title    : I cant tell if i belong here or not
Selftext :
So pretty much like everyone here I've never been able to burp, at least not in the same way everyone else does. Last month i had a ton of stomach and gut issues and experienced a lot of what i thought was burping but i dont think it is? Its like i have a bubble of air that travels up my throat it makes like a noise but I've never been able to do it on command and never loudly like people usually do? And i almost always have a stomach ache (which sometimes i cant tell if its hunger or gas) accompanied by a lot of this "burping" which can last for hours. Are these symptoms what you guys experience? Sometimes i take simethicone to help with all the trapped gas or bloating and sometimes it helps

Title    : My "teach yourself how to burp" plan
Selftext :
After reading everyone's experience with the shaker exercise I've concluded that it CAN work but u gotta do some extra work.

So this is going to be my routine, everyday, for a week: 

- Shaker exercise: 3 reps, 3 sets per day. After meals 

- Shaker chin ups: touching your chin to your chest 30 times for 1 second 

- Neck sit ups: 30 reps on each side, 3 times per day. After the shaker exercises 

- Stretches: before or after each meal (I'll experiment with it) and couple times throughout the day whenever I feel tense

- Massages: do cricoid massage anytime i feel air stuck in my throat 

- Correcting tongue posture

I actually started doing more shaker exercises yesterday, i did 5 reps 3 times but it was too much for my poor neck so im reducing it to 3 reps and with all the additional exercises I'm doing it should be enough. 

If you're wondering if i noticed any changes yesterday from doing the shaker exercises then the answer is YES. KINDA. I noticed i could release my air bubbles more easily, they usually get stuck in my throat but yesterday i was able to let them out more easily i also did more of the croaking noises which is progress for me bc i dont usually do those and some of them even felt like almost burps! 

And by nighttime i was feeling less bloated than i usually do! 

I'm doing this for a week straight, i can update you guys if u want to. But I'm really determined to make this work, I don't have any other choice really. 

Please let me know if there's anything you think I should be adding to this routine or if there's anything i should change!

And yeah sorry the cricoid massage is still a mystery for me, but from what i understand u gotta massage somewhere under your Adam's apple with ur pointer finger and thumb. I don't do the massages often tho only when i really feel air stuck in my throat and i just do what i just described and it kinda helps

Also If you search "learned to burp" on

Title    : My one week burp progress update
Selftext :
This post's going to be kinda long, sorry! 

Hello! I posted here a week ago that i would try following various techniques for a week in hopes of learning how to burp, and would update you guys if you wanted (https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/mdq2mh/my_teach_yourself_how_to_burp_plan/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 

Well, it's been a week. Have i learned how to burp? No 

Did i have an accidental burp tho? YES 

Okay so, I only had one legit burp in the entire week of doing this but hear me out 

I had a lot of tiny improvements like even tho i wasn't burping, the "air bubbles" that usually get stuck in my throat were going out more easily than before, they weren't getting stuck anymore and if they did all i had to do was stretch my neck a little bit or massage my throat and it would come out! 

I started this on Friday and burped on Wednesday, it was kinda tiny but it was definitely a burp. I was just sitting in bed doing some work stuff and i was just having my mini burps where it was just the air bubbles getting unstuck from my throat and then i felt this one coming that i thought would be a croak but it wasn't! It was a legit burp, it even had a taste too which is also how i know it was a burp 

And about the exercises, i did them all *almost* everyday. I had to let my neck rest on saturday because it was so sore from all the exercises that even my throat was sore and it was hard to talk (i was okay the next day tho) so even tho i didn't do the shaker, chin ups or sit up exercises that day i did do the stretching 

Omg the stretching exercises... someone said this before but i think the stretches really are the key here. Now that doesn't mean that the shaker exercises are useless, i think they do help but maybe it's more successful if you're also doing the stretches since you're relaxing your throat 

Some cons from all of this: 

-it might make your croaking worse: i personally don't mind the croaking because it relieves me from all the bubbles stuck in my throat but if you're anxious about it then I'd say to tread carefully. Try out doing stretches first and see if they help and if they don't make it worse then move on to shaker exercises 

- you might get acid reflux: I'm not someone who usually gets acid reflux but i did notice my throat burning a bit after meals a couple times during the week, it didn't last long tho. But if you're someone who has issues with that then I'd say the same, tread carefully 

I also had some other days this week when i almost had a burp but turned out to be a croak, also so many hiccups, i think someone mentioned that a hiccup might be a burp trying to come out but i can never tell when they're coming so im never ready for them 

Conclusion: i think the exercises with the stretches and massages WORK, or they have a chance of working so they're worth a try. Keep in mind I've been doing this for only a week and I've already seen some improvement, I'm willing to keep going and to update u guys. If we can find a method that can teach us how to burp without spending ridiculous amounts of money then i think it's worth it

Just some basic stretching exercises for tension, they're all basically the same if you google them so u can't go wrong with any of them but i just do the typical stretching from side to side, up and down (looking at the ceiling and then down with ur chin touching your chest) rotating my neck, shrugging my shoulders and all that, they're pretty easy to do and u can do them anywhere so I try to do them whenever i feel a little tense and especially before and after any meal

Title    : Currently suffering
Selftext :
I'm currently dealing with the absolute worst bloat sesh that I've ever felt before. I'm 21F with r-cpd. I've never really burped or been able to let air out easily my entire life, but this seems to be the worst it's ever gotten. I just came home from dinner out. I had a veggie burger, some fries, and a Shillings hard cider. I was hungry so I ate everything pretty fast and it's hot outside, which makes everything feel worse. I'm also a lightweight (I literally weigh 88 pounds) so liquor hits me fast, especially if I haven't had a drink in a while. 

Long story short, I am currently laying belly up on my bed, bloated as hell, watching the room spin, and on the brink of nausea- just from quickly eating a burger and downing some cider. I wish so badly I could just burp and get relief like everybody else. I am in a lot of pain! Does anyone have any tips for times like these? For starters, I really think I should cut out carbonated bevvys :(

Title    : Pain when swimming
Selftext :
I was wondering if any other non-burpers have this too. When I go swimming, almost immediately when I've been paddling in the water, I get extreme pain in my chest/esophagus. It feels like a big painful hiccup or I guess how I imagine heartburn feels. It makes me feel like I can't breathe. It's worse when I first start swimming, gradually gets better, but I always seem to get it when I'm doing movement in water. I've never known anyone else that gets this, and people never believe me. 

When I was a kid,  I would get it so bad when swimming with friends that I would have to stop playing and go rest. I imagine a huge air bubble bobbing up in my body as I jostle in the water. Has anyone else had this? It's extremely uncomfortable and it sucks! It makes going in the pool not very fun.

I just wish I could be normal and comfortable with swimming!

Title    : Body Dysmorphia?
Selftext :
I'm 21f and I struggle a lot with my r-cpd. Recently, I've been bothered by the bloating and how it makes my body look. I am small, under-weight and always have been. (5 feet and 90 lbs). My bloat makes me feel "bigger" and also makes me very physically uncomfortable. Especially now that it's summer, wearing tighter clothes like bathing suits and tank tops is hard for me not only because they feel tight, but I feel like my belly is popping out and everything is puffy. It makes me self conscious. I feel like I'm constantly wearing some kind of skin tight suit I can't take off. When I'm full, my stomach is distended like I'm pregnant and the skin feels so firm and tight you could bounce coins off of me.

I've never struggled with my body before and I would say in general I'm very confident in myself, but recently I'm starting to hate my bloating and the negative effect it's having on my body image. :-/ 

I've started taking GasX at meals and I see a little improvement.

Placebo or not, I think taking a chewable Tums before my meal tonight could have made my usual symptoms of noburb more tollerable. 

I had thai food and a beer and usually and lately I've cut out carbonation completely for how uncomfortable and sick it makes me, but tonight I felt a little better than average. Slight bloat after, but nothing near as crazy and horrible as it usually is. It was completely tolerable! Could it be the Tums helped?

I am worried bc I have serious Gerd but I am going to do the procedure.  I am convinced the rcpd is somehow contributing to my Gerd. Stay tuned!

Title    : Minimizing the croak without Botox or air vomiting
Selftext :
I‚Äôm 15, almost 16.  I‚Äôve dealt with occasional croaking after I eat my entire life, but it‚Äôs become constant ever since puberty started. I just found this subreddit today, and it feels so good to see that my body doesn‚Äôt completely hate me and that there are people dealing with the same problem.
 I want to teach myself to burp, but because I doubt I‚Äôd be able to get Botox until I‚Äôm an adult and because I can‚Äôt stand the feeling of vomiting, for now my main priority is to just minimize the embarrassing croaks or at least make it quieter. I‚Äôve been able to somewhat minimize it by eating less food in a small amount of time, exhaling more often both during and after eating, and moving more quickly when I get up or sit down if that makes sense, but I want to know if there are any other ways to minimize it. Any help would be appreciated!

Today was my first full school day trying to prevent the croak. I used all the tips I‚Äôve learned along with some advice I was given in my last post, and I managed to greatly decrease the gurgling (aside from a few of them still slipping out but I expected that), but it ended up just making me really need to pass gas for some reason. I‚Äôm starting to think it would just be more convenient if I taught myself to burp so I could kill two birds with one stone. Any decent places to start?

Title    : Do gaps between meals affect noburp?
Selftext :
So my (16) school starts at a pretty normal time, 7:30, but my lunch period is at 11:18 which I consider kinda early as someone who has lunch between noon and 1 on weekends. Is this smaller than normal gap between meals making my gurgles worse, or is it just my anxiety not wanting to deal with the gurgles in school that make me feel that way? Either way I think gonna start waiting until after school ends to eat my lunch because the gurgles are still hell even though I‚Äôve somewhat improved my ability to microburp on command :(

Title    : Ways I‚Äôve minimized the gurgles without air vomiting
Selftext :
I‚Äôve calmed down from my last post about worrying about the gurgles, and today I tried doing a few things to quiet them down or make them less frequent. They seem to have worked really well today, so I wanna share some of them with you guys if anyone else might need them.

1. Proper posture‚ÄîI noticed that slouching down makes the gurgles way more likely to happen, so now I try to be more aware of whether I‚Äôm sitting up straight and have my shoulders and tongue in the correct positions. You can easily get your shoulders in the right position by just rolling them back, and you can get your tongue in the right position by making sure it stays at the roof of your mouth, but this can be a bit hard at first. When you feel a gurgle coming, stay in this proper position, but try to stick your neck and chin out a little bit. This will turn the gurgle into a hiccup or micro-burp like 60% of the time.
2. Eating‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure how to properly describe this one, but I noticed that most people have their mouth wide open when they‚Äôre about to put food in it. I think doing this caused me to swallow more air, so what I‚Äôve been doing is keeping my mouth closed when the food gets close to my mouth, and when I actually eat it, I gradually open my mouth as I put the food in, just enough for it to fit, and then keep it shut after I take a bite. I also try to chew for longer than normal, at least for 15-30 seconds until it‚Äôs mostly turned to mush. This will look and feel awkward, but it will be worth it. I can guarantee it‚Äôs helped me the most out of all this stuff I listed in minimizing the gurgles today.
3. Staying calm‚ÄîThis is obviously way easier said than done, especially since just having the gurgles can make you more upset and anxious sbout other people hearing them. The ways I‚Äôve tried to stay calm after eating, specifically during my classes, are by 1) trying to go back to the carefree attitude I had as a younger kid, before my noburp symptoms got severe and they were the least of my worries and 2) focusing on something else like my homework. Sitting up straight like I mentioned before can also make you feel more confident.
4. Shaker exercise‚ÄîYou guys are probably already familiar with this, but I knew I had to still mention it. I‚Äôve just been doing it as much as possible recently out of desperation to make the noburp symptoms go away quicker, but on a normal day, I do 3 sets of the exercise where you keep your head up for 60 seconds twice a day (once after breakfast and once after dinner). If you‚Äôre new to noburp or don‚Äôt know what the shaker exercise is, you can search up ‚Äúshaker exercise noburp‚Äù or something similar on YouTube.

Overall, all of these things put together have quieted and decreased the amount of gurgles I‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôve been hiccuping and micro-burping way more frequently today. Fingers crossed that the micro-burps will eventually turn into normal burps ü§û I hope some of these tips work for you guys too!

Hello again noburp community. This is something I‚Äôve been wondering for a while, but I‚Äôve been too scared to ask.

Title    : I need Botox and help
Selftext :
I apologize for how long this post is or if this isn‚Äôt allowed. I guess this is a call for help, I don‚Äôt really know anymore   
I (16) have been suffering with R-CPD my whole life with the symptoms only getting worse as I get older. As I was starting high school, I thought I could just suffer through it and deal with getting treatment when I‚Äôm a financially stable adult, but I can‚Äôt keep trying to fake having a normal life anymore. I‚Äôve had moments with friends, teachers, and acquaintances ruined because of my embarrassing and debilitating symptoms. I‚Äôm kept up at night thinking about all the fun stuff I‚Äôve missed out in due to R-CPD symptoms taking away my energy and focus. It feels like I‚Äôm never really there.  I feel so alone.

I want to get Botox ASAP. I want to start living normally without worrying about gurgles or gas or getting nauseous when I eat something with just a little too much air. I do need some help trying to educate my father on R-CPD, though. I‚Äôve seen the Bastian papers so I could probably show him those, but‚Ä¶how do I even introduce this to him? He‚Äôs very skeptical of most stuff he sees on the internet, and I‚Äôve already had trouble talking with him about health issues in the past. Last time I tried to tell him about my symptoms while being super vague (because the symptoms are so embarrassing and he‚Äôs not my doctor) but that didn‚Äôt work. He just took me to the pediatrician who gave me Pepsid. This time, I need to take the time to sit down with him and explain R-CPD to him, including every single symptom and how I have almost all of them. He‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs been raising me, so he has to at least recognize some of the symptoms in me and be like ‚Äúoh yeah they might have that‚Äù. But he‚Äôll probably still have a moment where he doubts the credibility of this stuff just because it came from the internet, and that‚Äôs what makes me anxious.

 I also have to somehow convince him to take me straight to a doctor that can treat it. Pediatrician didn‚Äôt work, and the GI probably won‚Äôt either, but I know he‚Äôll wanna go with one of those first before he goes to an R-CPD doctor even though Spiegel is in our state.

TL;DR, I badly want to get Botox because of how debilitating my R-CPD has been, but I need help getting my father to listen to me and take my concerns seriously since he‚Äôs so skeptical about stuff he sees on the internet.

If anyone in this subreddit works at Jefferson surgical center or works with Dr. Spiegel I am so sorry. I was that person who didn‚Äôt drink any water this morning and had to get put to sleep for the IV to go in. This goes for any surgery and not just the Botox, but even though it‚Äôs important to remember not to eat anything after a certain time until surgery, it‚Äôs just as important to keep drinking water until the specific time you‚Äôre told to stop! Staying hydrated makes it easier for the IV to go in! Please, don‚Äôt be a dumbass like I was

This post mirrored my feelings pre-Botox all too well. This condition took away my ability to enjoy things like eating and laughing out of fear that an embarrassing gurgle would come out at the wrong time or I‚Äôd be in pain for the rest of the day. I isolated myself from people I cared about because I thought nobody could understand what was wrong with me. When the condition was at its worst, all I ever did in my free time was sleep off the symptoms.   
It sounds like R-CPD is beginning to impact your mental health like it did for me. I strongly implore you to go on the wiki and find the specialist closest to you. Getting the Botox 2 months ago changed my life. I still have the occasional weird throat noises, but I‚Äôm no longer fixating on if/when I eat and how much pain I‚Äôll be in afterwards. I can actually have a life.

Aside from how unhealthy most processed foods are, I think this could also have to do with the anxiety of being around other people and the pressure to look good around others. My R-CPD probably wouldn‚Äôt have been half as bad if I didn‚Äôt also have terrible social anxiety.

Title    : 10 months post botox‚ÄîI can function but still have some issues
Selftext :
I (18) got the botox in November of last year with Dr. Spiegel. After the initial month of burping too much and having post-botox symptoms, I‚Äôve been able to pretty much forget I ever had the condition, which is great! But I‚Äôve realized I still have some minor issues and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of the botox wearing off or if I have some other conditions.

First off, I‚Äôm able to burp, but unless I ate a huge meal, I‚Äôm almost never able to do it right after I eat. It usually takes an extra 10-30 minutes for the burp to come out. I can feel in my chest that something has to come out but won‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs awful. I just want to eat without being in any discomfort :( could it be the specific foods I‚Äôm eating?

Second, even though I believe I fart less often now, I still feel like I do it more than the average person. I really don‚Äôt know what could cause this other than R-CPD, because I don‚Äôt really eat many gassy foods.

The last thing is that I still get occasional noises in my throat and stomach. They're not like the gurgles‚Äîthey‚Äôre not constant, they usually only happen right after I ate something, and they seem to be quieter than gurgles, but they‚Äôre still an annoyance. Once again, could this have to do with the foods I‚Äôm eating, or not doing enough exercises post-botox?

If anyone else has had these issues post-botox despite being able to burp, please let me know and if you had any solutions! (or just got diagnosed with something else lol)

I got the botox the day before Election Day so I automatically got a free day off school, and it was definitely needed. But I think I should‚Äôve taken the rest of the week off because I felt awful trying to focus on schoolwork while constantly burping and struggling to eat anything due to the slow-swallow (especially in an environment as judgmental as school, but work may be different).

It ultimately depends on how good you‚Äôre feeling and what your work is like, but I think any day off after the surgery is better than nothing.

Didn't get ARFID, but just a fear of eating big meals or eating too fast. I‚Äôve been eating ridiculously slow so I swallow less air, and I was hoping I‚Äôd stop doing that after botox because I was always feel guilty for holding up my friends when we eat out. But I just continued to be scared of eating faster because I didn‚Äôt want to experience having air trapped in my chest/throat ever again.

I think this is actually making it harder to burp because there‚Äôs less air to come out‚Ä¶if that makes any sense. Like, if I stop caring and scarf down a huge meal, a burp will almost always come out. But since I feel like I can only eat small meals and must eat them slowly, it takes longer for there to be enough air for my body to go ‚Äúokay time to release this.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if this happens to anyone else or if I‚Äôm crazy.

Leaving a comment because I‚Äôm in a similar situation. One year post op, I can burp and function like a normal person (no longer hyperfixating on whether eating something will put me in pain for the rest of the day) but I also can‚Äôt burp voluntarily and can only let out small burps when I‚Äôve eaten a whole meal‚Äôs worth of food. It‚Äôs super annoying when I‚Äôve eaten something small and can feel that air needs to come out.

My god, I wish this was talked about more. Until I got the Botox in my senior year of high school, I went entire school days not eating anything because I knew the gurgles and pain would distract me from my work and humiliate me. When I got home I‚Äôd basically binge eat 2 whole meals worth of food to make up for skipping breakfast and lunch and then I‚Äôd just sleep off the R-CPD symptoms until dinner. It was‚Ä¶really bad.

The only thing that‚Äôs helped me get over my fear of eating like a normal person post-Botox is knowing that eating more will mean I‚Äôm more likely to burp because more food eaten = more air in the body, which in the context of being post-Botox is good!

Stuff like this is so hard to go through but I completely understand this pain. I hope one day you can enjoy eating again without worrying about pain ‚ù§Ô∏è

Pro: To this day, even post-Botox, I refuse to drink soda or any unhealthy carbonated beverage. Other than the fact that they look unappetizing to me, burn my mouth, and are obviously unhealthy, I just know they would‚Äôve destroyed me back when my symptoms were worse.

Con: My symptoms worsened once I hit puberty, and I was already dealing with unrelated anxiety and being a school student during the pandemic, so my social life was basically deader than dead. All those factors combined to make me terrified to even try to talk to people. I‚Äôm lucky I had classes with people who‚Äôd eventfully become close friends in my later years of high school, but the early years when my symptoms were debilitating me and my anxiety was through the roof probably did irreversible damage to my social development.

Any kind of ‚Äúmessy‚Äù food that required me to take multiple quick bites to stop it from spilling everywhere would cause more air to get in my throat and thus more gurgles. Huge sandwiches with the filling leaking out in between the bread, melting ice cream, etc.

When I was recovering from the Botox I experienced 2 or 3 laryngospasms, which is a sensation where you feel like you‚Äôre choking when you‚Äôre not, after eating some spicier food. It can feel really distressing experiencing it for the first time, but you just have to remember you are \*not dying\* and you are \*not actually choking.\* The feeling would usually go away for me after 1-2 minutes and drinking water. I also had to avoid anything too hot, spicy, or generally hard to swallow to prevent it from happening again.

I don‚Äôt want this temporary side effect to discourage you from getting the botox! Going through one month of uncontrollable burping, slow swallowing, and a couple of laryngospams is way better than a lifetime of worsening symptoms from being unable to burp. My quality of life improved so much after I got the operation done. I just wanted to make you aware of this side effect since I didn‚Äôt see it mentioned in the other comments.

Title    : Vomiting?
Selftext :
Does this condition always come with vomiting? I believe I have it but I have a phobia of vomiting, so I do everything I can in order to not vomit. I don‚Äôt burp, my hiccups are painful, I get the gurgling noise sometimes, and I also get chest and throat tightness at times. The only times I burp are when I‚Äôm about to be sick or very rarely at random times. I‚Äôd say it happens maybe once or twice a year.

Selftext :
Hey guys. Please tell me if you experience this too. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety thing, but for about a month I‚Äôve been dealing with watery mouth. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm producing way more saliva than I should be. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs a symptom of acid reflux, but it happens even when I‚Äôm not experiencing any acid reflux. It‚Äôs really annoying and I feel like I‚Äôm constantly swallowing my spit to get it out of my mouth. It‚Äôs super watery and thin too. Does anyone else experience this? How do I make it stop!!!

Title    : No doctors near me :(

Guys I‚Äôm looking online and there‚Äôs no doctors near me that treat R-CPD. I‚Äôve requested appointments with some ENT specialists in my area, but I‚Äôm worried that they won‚Äôt know how to treat or diagnose it and it‚Äôll be a waste of money. Could I go to the ER and explain my symptoms and ask to speak to an ENT at the hospital? What should I do?? My emetophobia is getting worse by the day and it controls my life. I‚Äôm always uncomfortable, bloated, hyper-salivating, and gurgling. My hiccups are extremely painful and I‚Äôll get them multiple times in one day when I get them. I just want it to stop and now that I know of this condition, it seems impossible to ignore it. Please help! I need advice.

Title    : Post-Botox?
Selftext :
For those of you who have gotten Botox treatment, did you experience vomiting afterwards? I want to get diagnosed and treated, but I have severe emetophobia. I don‚Äôt want to get this treated if it means I‚Äôm going to vomit frequently or at all. I had a feeling it may cause vomiting due to the fact that the muscle in the throat would finally be relaxed enough to let things pass through. I‚Äôm so terrified of vomiting but I want to feel better and the thought of throwing up without being treated is bad too because it‚Äôs so uncomfortable and painful. I‚Äôm so afraid either way.

Title    : Can anyone tell me what this is?
Selftext :
Hey guys. I‚Äôm having an issue that seems to happen daily now, and I can‚Äôt figure out what it is based on google. I don‚Äôt have a primary care physician, so my only option at the moment is urgent care, and I don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôd be much help. 

I started noticing that my saliva was really thin and watery all of a sudden. It also seemed like I was producing a lot of saliva compared to normal. It‚Äôs been weeks, and this hasn‚Äôt changed. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm just swallowing my spit. Keep in mind that I‚Äôm not nauseous or anything. I‚Äôm not sure if this would be considered hypersalivation, as I‚Äôm not drooling throughout the day or anything.

Then, I started noticing liquid coming up in my throat (not into my mouth) but it doesn‚Äôt burn or irritate my throat at all. It just feels like water honestly. I don‚Äôt have heartburn either. I thought it may be acid reflux, but everything I‚Äôve read about that says it has a bitter taste and irritates the throat. This has been happening consistently every day for weeks.  

I‚Äôm not nauseous, but sometimes I‚Äôll have so indigestion/sour stomach. This doesn‚Äôt always happen, so I‚Äôm not sure if the indigestion would be related to the things mentioned above. I‚Äôve been dealing with some constipation for a few months too, but I‚Äôm not extremely bloated and I‚Äôm still able to ‚Äúgo‚Äù, just not as frequently as I‚Äôd like. I just want to know if anyone has any experience with these symptoms. I have no idea how to treat them properly if I don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôve been taking antacids, but I can‚Äôt really tell if they‚Äôre doing much at all.

Title    : Post Botox vomiting?
Selftext :
Hey guys. I‚Äôve been reading a lot on this condition and a lot of articles talk about how vomiting with R-CPD can be painful and traumatic. This is because it feels like you have to FORCE it out of you because the esophageal sphincter won‚Äôt relax enough to let it out easily. I believe this is where my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) comes from! I‚Äôve always had an extremely hard time throwing up, and it takes every ounce of force I have in me to get it out. I always thought this was normal, but apparently most people don‚Äôt have this much trouble with it‚Ä¶ it just comes out? 

This may be an odd question, but has anyone noticed a difference in vomiting before vs after Botox? Is it easier? Less painful? Does it just come out without a fight? Please let me know! This is a huge concern for me because my emetophobia is so bad.

Title    : Question about r-cpd treatment for anyone who who‚Äôs had it done
Selftext :
I went in for my Botox consult last week and have my appointment scheduled for next week (yay!!!). My Dr. actually didn‚Äôt give me a ton of info on the condition so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here can give me answers. 

For people who have had the procedure and CAN burp, does air naturally release up your esophagus during the day without you burping? In other words, once I‚Äôve had the Botox will I feel relief after eating a meal, for example, without having to burp? Or is relief only felt when you burp? Do people with a functional esophagus go about their day burping all day? Or are they less likely to need to burp since they don‚Äôt have a bunch of trapped air? 

I hope this makes sense haha.

Usually it‚Äôs not a choice. My doctor said he prefers doing it under anesthesia because there‚Äôs more control and you can see the muscle internally as opposed to just feeling it on the outside. I think it‚Äôs more of a benefit for the doctor rather than the patient as there are definitely risks being put to sleep. 

I had to push for it to be done in office. I work in healthcare and anesthesia is hard on the body point blank period so I really wanted to avoid it unless medically necessary. It sounds like the only real downside is that it can be less effective and uncomfortable (I think a lot of people aren‚Äôt keen to have a needle in their neck). But he said if it doesn‚Äôt work the first time then we can try again, or I can still choose to go under as a last resort.

Title    : Failed Botox procedure. Feeling discouraged
Selftext :
Just got back from my awake Botox procedure in Seattle. I was warned that doing it awake is less precise than asleep, and unfortunately I was one of the unlucky people it didn‚Äôt work out for. My Dr. was wonderful and attempted 3 times, but wasn‚Äôt getting the correct electrical feedback from the muscle and decided against trying to Inject. He was very apologetic and said he was reach out to a colleague with more experience doing it awake- or that we would move forward doing the procedure asleep if all else failed. I‚Äôm super bummed but hopeful it will work out in the future.

Title    : So glad to have found you!
Selftext :
Hello all! Wow, when I discovered this reddit was a thing, I signed up immediately‚Äîso bear with me, because I‚Äôve never used reddit before. 

I‚Äôm a 24 year old female, and I‚Äôve never been able to burp (I‚Äôve done it three times in my life, total, and it startled me all three times). The last time I burped was five years ago while belting a song in my car, and it just came out. I screamed.

I‚Äôve never been able to find any medical condition or diagnosis for it, and when I‚Äôve brought it up to my doctor she doesn‚Äôt have any comments. (She likely thinks I don‚Äôt burp often, not that I don‚Äôt do it at all.)

I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled to see that it‚Äôs finally getting looked into! Hurrah for solidarity! Nice to meet you folks. No-burp buddies for life. (Too over the top? I‚Äôm just excited.)

Title    : Reflux relief?
Selftext :
Hi guys. I‚Äôve been having a ton of really terrible acid buildup in my stomach periodically during this quarantine, probably from excess stress. But I‚Äôm wondering too if it might also be because I‚Äôm unable to burp. Do any of you guys have bad acid reflux, and if so, what‚Äôs your go-to to relieve it? I had so much trouble getting to sleep last night because of it and I‚Äôm still feeling bad this morning, with the telltale burning, acid-tasting sensation in the back of my mouth. (I‚Äôm going to try a natural antacid this morning, but I‚Äôm sometimes afraid to because I feel in the past antacid has made things worse...)

I‚Äôll keep that in mind. I‚Äôll just take a little antacid here and there and see what that does for me to start. Already I took it and I‚Äôm feeling very gurgle-y, so hopefully that‚Äôs not counterintuitive...

I‚Äôve always been really hesitant to take any sort of drug. My stomach is historically very weak with most medications, and I get so paranoid about the long lasting effects of most things that I end up just trying natural where I can. These antacid tablets I bought are like...organic calcium something or other, so I‚Äôll give those a try and report back.

Me too! I‚Äôve tried to explore why but usually come up short. For me personally I think my anxiety is worse in the evening, which contributes. Your GI system also isn‚Äôt fond of laying in a relaxed position after eating dinner, so that could also be the culprit if you don‚Äôt allow yourself two to three hours after eating before you lay down or slouch.

Try gently rubbing your entire abdomen (from stomach down to the lowest parts of your intestines) in a clockwise motion with your hand, or with your finger nails. This helps promote GI movement. I‚Äôve also recently been doing gentle side twists while standing, where I twist my torso to the left, then to the right, then repeat until I start to feel some relief. Lastly, some say that heating helps dissipate gas in the intestines and reduce bloating. If you‚Äôve got a heating pad, give it a try by laying it across your stomach. Not too hot, though. And I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to do that directly after eating‚Äîsomething about digestion and heat don‚Äôt mix, which is why you aren‚Äôt supposed to take a hot shower after eating either. (Speaking of hot showers, those might be helpful for evening bloating too, because they can calm you down and relax parts of your body.)

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for now! Good luck OP and others. We‚Äôll figure this out.

Title    : Almost burp!
Selftext :
Hey guys! Had an exciting thing that no one but you guys would understand. Hahaha

I‚Äôve been trying to force my air out more and do little exercises around my throat (including gently tapping around the throat/collarbone when I‚Äôm getting gurgles). Just now I was feeling like my stomach was a bit full of air, so I did a little exercise of gently pushing both thumbs just below the sternum and leaning back, stretching the stomach, and then forward. And I had...an almost burp. It felt different, and it definitely wasn‚Äôt a full burp, but it‚Äôs like I could feel the muscle trying to loosen to let just a little bit of air out.

Anyway, I thought I‚Äôd share, in case anyone else wants to give this a try! Might have just been a coincidence, but I‚Äôll take all I can get.

I don‚Äôt have any advice on how to burp, but here‚Äôs some other advice for making yourself feel better: no carbonated drinks. Like, at all. No soda, no sparkling water. Just stay away from it. It can be hard when you‚Äôre in high school, since some kids seem to live off of soda, but just don‚Äôt do it. And, when the time comes, no beer! I can‚Äôt drink for a separate issue, but I‚Äôve heard people here comment that beer can be absolutely monstrous for this condition. 

Basically, pay attention. See what in your diet is working and what isn‚Äôt. Maybe even keep a food log so you don‚Äôt have to remember it all. I know it sucks to have to do a little bit extra and avoid some things, but it‚Äôs better to feel good than to feel bad and do everything unrestricted. And it‚Äôll help your stomach in the future if you start taking care of it now! 

Good luck, friend. If you ever need someone to talk to, I‚Äôm always available via dm as well. (I‚Äôm a 24f who has only burped three times in my life and have done a lot of trial and error to find what makes me feel best.)

But your other issues I think merit a doctor‚Äôs visit if you haven‚Äôt been to see one already. You could be struggling with some underlying condition and not even know it. So, if you have the means, please schedule an appointment. Finding a good doctor who listens to you and your needs will be instrumental in helping you feel better!

Good luck!

This condition is so new in the medical world that I‚Äôm not sure how much a doctor could help. But if you start getting really intense and painful symptoms that don‚Äôt go away or that are reducing your quality of life, you might want to check in with a gastroenterologist to make sure no damage is being done to your stomach or gut. Until then...all you can do is try to eat well for your body and find relief where you can.

I see people recommending Botox here, and i think it‚Äôs a great solution when you‚Äôre having unbearable symptoms (I‚Äôve found ways to manage mine so Botox is not on my future at the moment, but I‚Äôve seen it help a lot of people).

I manage mine with diet and gentle movements. Absolutely no carbonated drinks. Period. No soda, no beer (which you hopefully shouldn‚Äôt be having at your age anyway!), no sparkling water. Our bodies don‚Äôt have the capacity to expel carbonation, so it sits in our stomachs and causes damage. 

Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Overstuffing your stomach can cause an already stressed stomach to become damaged, and you could even develop a hiatal hernia, as I‚Äôve seen some people here talk about. Be very aware of how you‚Äôre eating, too‚Äîdon‚Äôt inhale your food. Take small, slower bites to prevent from swallowing excess amounts of air that could cause gas buildup in your stomach.

Do gentle twists from side to side with your arms pulled up slightly. I‚Äôm my experience this helps me stretch and relax my stomach muscle when I‚Äôm experiencing bloating. Additionally, I sometimes rub the surface of my stomach in a clockwise motion to help settle buildup. 

Don‚Äôt lay down after you eat. This is one that I‚Äôve seen other people suggest, and maybe it‚Äôs just me personally that can‚Äôt handle it, but I almost always have stomach pain if I lay down after eating. It‚Äôs fine while laying down‚Äîit hurts once I stand. Just try to cut your gut and digestive system a break by giving it enough room to do its thing.

Try to force the air out of your stomach. I get the gurgles you‚Äôre talking about very frequently. You have to try to coax them up and simultaneously work on visualizing relaxing that cricopharengeus muscle. I‚Äôve found leaning forward slightly and turning my head a bit to the left helps small amounts of air escape for relief. I haven‚Äôt achieved actual burping this way yet, but I feel like I‚Äôm making progress.

Just stay positive as much as you can! Stress can also cause gas buildup, so just take some deep breaths, know you‚Äôre not alone, and do what you can to make yourself feel better.

Good luck!

Title    : Curious about shoulder structure
Selftext :
Hi friends! 

I‚Äôve noticed in the past few years how much my shoulders naturally cave forward. I‚Äôve been trying to push them back in exercises, which pulls on my chest and makes me feel pretty strained. I‚Äôm wondering if this pulled-forward orientation of my shoulders might be causing some kind of ripple effect that affects the cricopharyngeus muscle. Does anyone else find they hold their shoulders this way?

I could definitely see that affecting other muscles in the body, for sure.

Title    : Botox injection affects on vocal cords
Selftext :
Though I've never been diagnosed with RCPD, I am fairly certain that I have it, having never really been able to burp... I probably burp spontaneously like maybe once or twice a year, and have only been able to pass wind otherwise by sticking my fingers down my throat and 'air-vomiting' (it blows my mind that this is a whole thing that other people do - I've always felt like such a freak lol). Having only this week discovered from this reddit that there's a doctor in the UK that does the botox procedure to treat RCPD, I am thinking seriously about getting it done and feel so excited that there could be a solution to this condition that's been causing me so much persistent discomfort my whole life!

Thing is, I'm a singer and I've read that the injection can affect your voice. Some people report their voice feeling weak or that the botox can reach their vocal cords?! The thought of not being able to sing or speak as I can now is extremely offputting, so I wondered if there are any other singers that have had the procedure and whether they are able to describe the effects it had on their voice? Or really anyone - I'd be super keen to learn more about the effects it can have on your ability to use your voice in general! Thanks :-)

honestly it feels like i have fewer and fewer options when it comes to alcoholic drinks. even non-carbonated drinks like wine or fruit juice mixers kinda fuck me up because of the acidity and high sugar content. my current go-to atm is amaretto and cranberry juice with a squeeze of lime, simply because it's totally delicious and tastes like a cherry bakewell! but it doesn't get me drunk and it still messes my stomach up a little bit. as irresponsible as it sounds, one of the main reasons i'd like to get the botox procedure is so i can enjoy a few more years of going out and drinking without my night becoming super painful!

Hiya Laura, I hope you don't mind me asking - is your procedure cheaper because you're not having GA? Will you have local anaesthetic instead? I'm based in the UK and am super keen to get the botox procedure, but from what I've read it's normally around ¬£3k, which is obviously quite a lot of money for many of us! The thought of going without pain relief is really daunting, but I'm keen to weigh up my options and figure out what would be best/cheapest/quickest!! Thanks so much and good luck :-)

I'm unsure if this is just me having other dietary weirdness and/or conditions besides my inability to burp, but strangely I find that when I need an energy boost, the foods that I enjoy the most and that cause me the least problems are high protein meals involving things like chicken or salmon, and I pretty much always have eggs for breakfast and that keeps my stomach settled throughout the day.

I've more or less stopped eating pasta unless it's gluten free (it's much better than it used to be and some brands taste more or less the same as regular pasta), and I try to avoid white/heavily processed bread. 

I drink a lot of peppermint tea after meals to settle my digestive system, and I only drink decaf coffee these days - it sucks because I love coffee, but if you're willing to spend a bit more you can find really tasty decaf.

Title    : Booking in with Dr Hicklin...
Selftext :
This is a bit of a daft question and such a privileged problem to have, but I feel like I'm trying to make a bit of an uninformed choice here!

So I'm in the process of booking in with Dr Hicklin for the Botox procedure - she has some availability either next Monday or 2 Mondays after that (the 30th). So both are logistically quite tricky but I'm SUPER keen to get it done as soon as possible so I'm trying to work out what's best. For a few reasons, the 30th is probably the easiest for me to book, BUT I'm going away on holiday from June 5th until the 12th! Am I silly to get the procedure done so close to my trip? It seems like the side effects will still be in full swing, and I'm wondering whether I'm going to wish I was at home eating soup and taking it easy. I'll be in Greece and I'm guessing I won't want to limit my ability to eat the delicious food there! That said, next Monday just feels so soon and will be tricky and expensive for me to get sorted (I don't live in London). Should I just bite the bullet for the sake of my trip?   


Anyone who's had the procedure (especially those who've had it without anaesthetic), how were you holding up at the 5 day-2 week mark?

Thanks for all of the replies! Against everyone's advice I've had to go with the later option :-/ next Monday unfortunately just isn't workable, I'm pretty frustrated about it but I've figured it will actually be easier for me to take the time off to recover before/during the holiday. By the time I go away it'll have been 6 days, and I guess the first couple of days might be a bit ropey but hopefully the remainder of the holiday will be okay besides some slow meal times. I'm planning on taking it super easy while I'm away anyway, much easier than I would be at home. Next Monday would have been brilliant but just not doable. I'm quite annoyed really as I've been trying to contact Parkside for weeks, it took 4 attempts to get referred over to the right contact details and I could've probably got booked in much sooner. But it is what it is eh.  
Fingers crossed I won't be spending my holiday on here pestering people about strange side effects, but I can't rule it out! I'll definitely be sure to update people on my progress anyway. Trying to focus on the positives of the outcome of the procedure and hope for the best!!

Didn't want to wait until after my trip because the next available appointments were over a month later - I'm off to Glastonbury in late June and I am desperate to get it done before that! I don't know if this is relatable to others, but I personally have had SO many long fun-filled days totally ruined by the pain I'm in by the end of the evening due to my inability to burp. Festivals and weddings are especially difficult and RCPD symptoms are literally inevitable - by the end of the day even breathing normally is an issue. It's super irritating too because I'll often have a ton of energy left to keep partying and having fun but I just feel like a huge balloon. If there's a possibility of me not suffering those symptoms at a week long festival, I'll take the pay off! Hopefully it'll be fine - it's not ideal but it felt like the most feasible option.

Ah luckily the first holiday is a trip with my parents and I'm expecting it be pretty sedate - booze was not on my agenda, just planning on taking it super easy and chilling on the beach! And as for the festival - tbh it's not even so much the booze that causes the issues, as I'm not a big drinker these days (not so much out of any conscious choice than RCPD making it physically impossible). I can eat and drink all of the right things and still feel like a big balloon at the end of a long day. It's just a general build up of gas that accumulates during a long busy day. So excited to know that there might be an end in sight for all those awful uncomfortable symptoms. Fingers crossed!

Oh yes 100%!! I always just accepted RCPD as a part of my life (back when I didn't even know there was an official diagnosis/name for it)... I just thought it was one of those sad little quirks that made my life trickier in a way that was somehow both minor and significant. I'd been to the doctors about it a few years back and of course was just fobbed off as a weird case of IBS with no further recommendations. Having found this community AND discovered in the same evening that there was a way that I could get it treated within weeks, I am now more conscious of the symptoms than I ever have been!! I'm keenly aware of every gurgle and of the restricted feeling in my throat, and super conscious of everything I eat and the differing sensations depending on where I am. Also it's always been worsened by anxiety - I've managed to keep most of that at bay by keeping really busy, but now that my procedure looms ever closer (next Monday!), it's definitely on my mind, and so my body is responding accordingly! When is your procedure?

I had my procedure on Monday morning and I'm already getting some burps! The slow swallowing is honestly not that bad either - I'm anticipating that it may get more severe over the next few days but as it is right now it's not at all panic-inducing like I expected it to be, more just quite strange? I totally understand your fear and was pretty nervous myself, so I'm super pleased to be feeling the positive results already :-) I'm sure you'll do great!

Title    : Had my procedure with Lucy Hicklin on Monday morning!
Selftext :
Just thought I'd leave a lil update after having had my procedure at Parkside with Lucy Hicklin on Monday morning! 

So the procedure itself was fine all in all - Lucy was friendly and calm but also quite businesslike in a way that implied to me that she has done the procedure many times before, which was reassuring. The appointment ran a little late which was a bit of a stress, as I had a pre-booked train ticket back up to Leeds a couple of hours later! I do wish I'd given myself a little bit longer to recover as the journey home was a bit much after the jab - but I made it home in one piece fine, albeit a bit frazzled. Possibly not the best idea to have to get public transport with 4 transfers to get back to my home after just being jabbed in the neck!

The procedure was about as unpleasant as I expected - I'm not super needle-averse but I don't particularly like them, and there's no way around the fact that getting an injection right in your throat is just not the nicest sensation. That said, it was incredibly quick (the procedure itself from putting the tape on my neck for the EMG machine to sitting back up again was genuinely a minute or two tops) and pain-wise was comparable to a vaccination or a blood test, just in a more sensitive spot. I had some pain in the back of my neck afterwards, but I think I'd just been tensing up a fair bit from the nerves. Like I mentioned, the travel stress didn't help and I wish I'd been able to be more relaxed. I also made the mistake of having the procedure on the day my period started - as those of us who have periods know, we're generally more sensitive to pain during that time. So another thing to bear in mind for anyone thinking about booking their procedure - check your cycle!

When I got home I enjoyed a takeaway and took it easy. There was a slight sensation of a lump in my throat and I was a little bit tender, but I took arnica tablets for a few days beforehand to try and curb any potential bruising. Whether this has had any significant effect I'm not sure, but there's no bruising whatsoever which is good. I made sure to stock up on Calpol and infants' Ibuprofen on the way home, but I haven't seemed to need them yet.

The day after the procedure I ate scrambled eggs on toast for breakfast as normal - I could feel a slight resistance as I was eating the toast, but the slow swallow hadn't quite kicked in just yet. As the day went on, I could feel things changing a little bit in my throat when I drank. By dinner time I could feel that food was harder to get down, but the sensation has not been anywhere near as panic-inducing as I'd been expecting. I had pasta with aubergine and mushrooms in a tomato based sauce, and the texture of the roasted veg and the sauce was actually great and easy enough to get down. I'm also perhaps lucky that I normally have scrambled eggs and a smoothie for my breakfast/lunch most days anyway, so I've been pretty unhindered so far! I'm anticipating that the slow swallow will get worse over the coming days, but if it stay as this level then that's just great.

The BEST news is that I'm already starting to burp a little bit! The first I got were some microburps yesterday when yawning and after eating my dinner, and then today I've had some small burps when yawning or stretching, and then a couple of hours ago I did my first proper legit sounding burp! I have burped before but they're normally either very small and irregular (ie like once or twice a year) OR I have to do a horrible uncomfortable air vomit. So a regular, unlaboured and normal-sounding burp was pretty exciting! Going to see how they go for the next few days, and then at the week mark I may try to induce burps and do some 'training' (lol) with some fizzy drinks.

I'm still getting the gurgles and bloating a little, but the difference is that some of these gurgles are now making it to the surface, and I'm feeling increasingly confident that as time goes on I'll be able to burp most of them out. The sensation of burping is still taking me by surprise so I think the next hurdle for me will be trying to go with them rather than resist. But I also know that it's very early days so I'm not going to push myself!

I'll keep you all posted as to how things progress over the coming days/weeks!

I self-diagnosed and then paid privately with Lucy Hicklin, who confirmed that my symptoms were most likely to be RCPD. Given how unknown the condition is even amongst medical professionals, there's currently no point really trying to get it recognised by your NHS GP.

Haha what are the chances! We are very much on the same timeline... yeah I'd say maybe take painkillers beforehand if you can? I will also say that my period pain was worse once it finally started too (as I predicted might happen, it held off from starting until a couple of hours after my treatment), I think I'd just been pretty tense and stressed so once the cramps kicked in they were extra intense. Do what you can to stay relaxed and best of luck!

No throat scope - she just asked me about my symptoms and was able to diagnose it that way. I think she can do the scope if you want to be extra sure that it's RCPD, but I can't imagine it's something that's often misdiagnosed - people know if they can or can't burp, y'know?! No local anaesthetic but tbh it's not that bad without. The only things that's fairly unpleasant is having to swallow and sniff while the injection is in your throat, but it's really so surprisingly fast. Just close your eyes, take deep slow breaths and do what you can to relax as that will really reduce the pain.

Definitely experiencing a little more difficulty with the side effects since yesterday - seems like the Botox is really kicking in so the UES feels totally out of action, and I have been out and about a bit more so finding it quite frustrating to constantly have to eat very consciously and slowly if I have company. Had a couple of times where I felt quite sick while eating because it was a struggle to get down. I went out to a gig last night to see how I'd get on - I didn't drink any booze, but my throat did feel quite strained while talking. I sort of feel like there's constantly a bubble in my throat? All that said, I am still getting a few burps, and the side effects are certainly manageable. Doesn't seem to be increasing massively since day 3 but I guess it's still early days. Will post a proper update!

Title    : UPDATE: post-procedure with Lucy Hicklin 30th May
Selftext :
Just wanted to give another lil update on my procedure in case it's of any interest to others considering getting the procedure - also I'd be quite interested to know how my experience aligns with others who are further ahead in their burp journey!

So the side effects of the Botox are definitely kicking in a bit more than they were when I updated on Wednesday night (I had the procedure on Monday morning). I've read a couple of times that days 5-10 are the toughest so I guess this is consistent with that given that I'm on day 5/6 now. Eating has become a real slog - it's fine if I'm just sat at home and can take my time, but it can be a bit of a nightmare if I have plans because it's taking me like 45 minutes to get through a small meal! Also really challenging when eating with company - it's not even worth trying tbh. I end up switching off and trying to eat too fast and getting myself into discomfort. I'm off on holiday with my mum and stepdad tomorrow and I think I'm going to have to ask them to not try to engage me in conversation while eating!! As well as this, my throat feels kind of strained in a way that's hard to describe. Talking is a little more tiring/strained than usual, and it sort of feels like I have a bubble in my throat? Burps are coming but they're small and unpredictable, and the thing that's quite tricky is that although I am getting some of the air out, I find that I'm swallowing that much more because the muscle is relaxed, if that makes sense. I think this is where the bubble sensation is coming from?

All that being said, I'm currently finding it all pretty manageable and fingers crossed I continue that way! The eating is the worst part but I'm still managing okay and I don't think it's quite as bad as I was expecting. The effect on my voice is manageable and I don't think it's created any audible difference in how I sound, it just feels sort of strange and tiring. The plus side is that I am getting burps out which is great. I think I believed it would progress in a more linear way, ie. getting easier to burp day by day - this has not really been the case for me. I had some good regular-sounding burps on days 3-4 and since then it's kind of been back to smaller burps, but tbh I think I'm perhaps just overanalysing a bit - they're happening and that's what matters! I've had 3 or 4 microburps just since I've been typing this update! They still feel quite uncomfortable/strained and the gurgles haven't dissipated yet (I think they have reduced though), but I'm just trying to be patient and hope that this will change over the coming week.

Something I had wondered with those that got the procedure already - what has been your recovery timeline with regards to the burps vs the slow swallowing? I've wondered whether the burping gets easier once the slow swallow starts to diminish, or whether it is this early stage that I should be capitalising on to try and get practising? I'm sort of reluctant to push too much while things are still fairly uncomfortable in there! Also I'm interested that so many people say the slow swallow settles after a couple of weeks or so - my instinct would be that it would last as long as the Botox is in effect, ie. 2-3 months? Can anyone describe their experience of this? Can you really go back to regular eating while the Botox is in effect? I'm already over the slow swallow BUT I can handle another week or 2 - months on the other hand, could get pretty disruptive!

But yes, all in all I think I'm doing okay?! I need to properly commit to the Shaker exercises in the meantime, but they're harder than I expected! Can barely lift my damn head!!

Ah mate, I feel this. Live music is my life and it's been so infuriating the number of nights that I've been so excited about, that have been made so uncomfortable by my inability to burp. It's actually the main reason I got the Botox done!

So it's interesting that so many say not to eat - I actually find that I will bloat just as badly, sometimes worse, if I'm out and about on an empty stomach. I do have ADHD and have to take meds for that, so skipping meals has other implications for me, and everyone is different. I will say that as I can't really get away with not eating regularly, I've found it best to avoid certain foods. High protein meals involving fish/chicken/eggs are the safest bet for me, and I try not to load up on carbs before going anywhere. I avoid pasta unless it's gluten free and I cut out dairy which has definitely curbed a fair amount of discomfort. As well as this, peppermint tea to settle the stomach has been a lifeline for me! Especially good if you have a nervous/anxious tummy.

Beyond this, as I've got older I've just become increasingly shameless when it comes to finding a spot to lie down on my side and try to fart lol. If anyone asks just say it's a medical thing (because it is) and try to give yourself a moment to relax when you can. I appreciate this is often easier said than done in certain situations, but sometimes it's the only way to give yourself relief! And besides that there's always the dreaded air vomiting which is hella unpleasant but is really effect for a last resort relief. 

Hope you manage to enjoy the show <3

wine was always a safer bet for me noburp-wise BUT of course it would get me hammered quite quickly so unsafe in other ways! my favourite at the moment is amaretto and cranberry juice with a squeeze of lime - it tastes like a cherry bakewell so it's almost a dessert, only good for those with a sweet tooth though. beer is an absolute no-go! i've just had my botox jab so i'm looking forward to maybe getting to drink it soon though.... ultimately my main advice is to tell your co-workers to piss off!

Title    : TWO (and a bit) WEEK UPDATE! Post-Botox with Dr. Hicklin
Selftext :
Hi all,

Just wanted to give another update on my progress since my procedure on the 30th May, in the hopes that it may be helpful for anyone considering getting the Botox!

So I've got to say I think I've had a pretty easy time of it compared to some of the stories I've read on here - I was expecting much worse in terms of the side effects. If you are putting off getting the procedure for fear of slow swallowing and acid reflux and general unpleasantness, I can reassure you that at least in my experience it really wasn't that bad! This is likely to do with the fact that I only got 50 units of Botox injected, which I think is one of the lowest amounts administered by any of the practitioners that do the RCPD procedure.

So yes, the jab itself was not pleasant and I hope I don't have to get it done again. There's just no way around the fact that your throat is a sensitive and weird place to get an injection! That said, it is super quick and over before you know it. I think Dr Hicklin had to give it two attempts to find the right muscle, and I had absolutely no bruising afterwards.

I would say that the worst days for side effects were days 4-8 for me. Day 4 was when the slow swallow started kicking in properly - I'd had it to some degree from day 2, but it wasn't until day 4 that it became disruptive. I cut out bread and ate curry/soupy food for my dinners and that was fine, but it did take me a long time to get through a meal which weirdly was more bothersome to me than the sensation of slow swallowing itself. Just didn't really enjoy feeling like I wasn't getting enough food inside me. As well as the slow swallow, my throat felt weird in general and talking could feel somewhat strained and uncomfortable. Socialising was tricky and my throat felt really tired after trying to talk for sustained periods of time. I tried to take it easy these days, as although I had started getting microburps within a couple of days of the jab, I was still getting the gurgles/bloating, and my RCPD symptoms were flaring up due to my general anxiety relating to the side effects and how I would progress over the coming weeks. That was as unpleasant as it got - it's quite easy to psych yourself out at that stage, convincing yourself that the procedure hasn't worked and that you'll be left unable to eat properly for weeks with no benefit!

Luckily, that stage was over MUCH more quickly than I'd expected. The slow swallow really did start to diminish after a week, and now at 2.5 weeks it's barely there at all. There's definitely an element of getting used to the sensation too - it's quite an unpleasant feeling but once you've got a feeling for what's going on in there when you eat, I think you just unconsciously start making the necessary adjustments. One thing I found during the rough patch was to stick to eating little and often; one day I left it too long and was really hungry, and kept getting myself into a state of discomfort because I was trying to hoof food down like a maniac, as I normally would if I'd been that ravenously hungry! Basically, do what you can to avoid extreme hunger!

I've had no acid reflux whatsoever and my voice feels more or less where it was pre-procedure. I'm a singer and I feel more or less okay singing now - belting it out feels slightly strained, but I'm not sure if this is just because I'd rested my voice for a couple of weeks and I'm simply out of practice! In any case I'm not worried and I've found ways around it. My eating feels almost back to normal now - the slow swallow is still there but it's not bothersome at all, just need to keep a glass of water handy. It is worse with some foods than others - rice is a bit tricky and so are oaty/nutty things, but again, nothing that a good swig of water can't remedy.

As for the burps, I've been getting 5 or 6 really decent burps out after every meal, and they're getting easier each day! I find that tilting my head down and turning my head to the right is what works for me. I need to commit to the Shaker exercises but I find them incredibly difficult - sometimes I try and I just can't even lift my head at all! So I think I'm going to get one of those little yoga balls and do those exercises instead. I still get the gurgles sometimes but now I'm generally able to get them out with a burp, and the insane bloating/chest pressure seems to be a thing of the past, which is just SO GREAT. 

Honestly, I really do recommend the procedure if you're on the fence. I went on holiday last week and I'm at a festival next week - and it is amazing to me to get to fully experience these occasions without having to come up with some sort of strategy or just resign myself to unbearable/unrelievable pain. I hope I don't have to get it done again and I need to really work on building up that muscle memory, but for the time being it is such a huge relief and has been so worthwhile!

Title    : ONE MONTH POST BOTOX: struggling to get the burps out!
Selftext :
Hi all,

Just another one of my updates plus a general question on people's later post-Botox journeys!

So it's been kind of a crazy month since I got my procedure done with Lucy Hicklin - within a few days I was on holiday in Greece with family, which was actually a really fortunate way to recuperate and I didn't find the side effects particularly disruptive to my holiday at all (fortunately it was a chilled one and I barely drank). Other than a couple of slow swallow ordeals when I was trying to hoof food down like a feral dog, it was generally fine lol! The burps progressed slowly and surely over the week, and I was glad to see positive progress

The following week went in a similar way, and I even went out and enjoyed some dancing and booze, and was thrilled to find that I suffered basically none of the usual horrible bloating symptoms! So far, so worth it.

Last week I went to Glastonbury and only dealt with the RCPD symptoms on one of the days. Generally I've been finding that tilting my head forward and turning to the right seems to do the trick for me. I still haven't had a ton of control when I'm out and about, and sometimes the burps will sneak out when laughing or coughing, but realistically I imagine this is true of a regular burpers so I haven't thought too much of it, and just enjoyed the fact of the ensuing relief however it's achieved! The one day that I did suffer a return to the RCPD symptoms was the one day I drank a lot of fizzy drinks - it was also my busiest, most tiring and most excitable day: Paul McCartney was my main reason for going to Glasto this year, and I'd been stewarding that morning so was running on literally a couple of hours of very poor quality sleep. As much as I'm gutted that I felt poorly as soon as his set was done, I wonder whether a combination of booze, lots of excitable singing along/gasping at all the wonderful songs and generally forgetting myself, plus already being generally physically exhausted may account for the resulting pain! It was frustrating to feel it again, but given that I would feel like that to some degree almost every day in the past, it was acceptable.

I've been home 4 days now and fairly inevitably I've been struck down with COVID, which honestly hasn't been that bad but I suppose I've not been eating or moving as much as normal, and I did spend two full days in bed. Now, I have to say I'm finding it harder and harder to get the burps out. I'm wondering whether I'm perhaps just being a bit neurotic about it - after all, it has only been one month and by anyone's estimate, the botox should still be in full effect, although I have read a couple of accounts from people who said it wore off very quickly? I'm wondering whether it's just because it's been such a jam-packed month that I'm forgetting it's still really early days - it feels like my procedure was ages ago, but it really wasn't! But the burps were coming much easier, and now these past couple of days I've really had to try very hard to just get little ones out. I guess it could be that with the lack of movement/smaller intake of food/no talking (I live alone), there just hasn't been much in there to burp in the first place?! I know I need to give it more of a go with fizzy drinks, but honestly they've caused me so much pain in the past it's almost like I have a physical aversion to them now - I'm so scared of drinking a full can of fizzy pop it's quite bizarre! I also need to commit to the Shaker exercises, but I still find them quite hard, and of course with it having been such a busy month I've found it difficult to be consistent with them.

Does anyone else have a similar experience to this? It is simply that it is harder on some days than on others and this is something I should just get used to? For those who needed a second jab, when did that become apparent to you?

Perhaps I was lucky, but I will say that the slow swallow symptoms were really not as bad as I thought they'd be, or at least certainly not as long-lasting. When you are struggling to swallow food you will instinctively want/need to wash it down with water or with any drink. It'd probably take me a full glass per meal, but at that point it's a case of weighing up the worse discomfort - I know a lot of people say they lose weight during that time because they found it difficult to eat at all, but for me going without food isn't an option! I just used water because it was easiest, you can use any drink. Your bloating symptoms relating to drinking water will definitely subside as you start to get the burps out after that first week or so. Your gurgles/bloating are not likely to subside much in that first week, but I didn't find them to be any worse than they had been up until that point.   


I'd say one of the best things about now being able to burp post treatment is that I find it so much easier and more comfortable to keep hydrated! The slow swallow for me was worst on days 4-9. After that it settled down, and you do just sort of get used to it too. I still kept a drink of water handy up until pretty recently (I'm 2 months post-botox), but you get so accustomed to your new 'mechanics' that it's no longer disruptive. Just take your time when you eat, and make sure to eat little and often so that you're not ravenous and tempted to gulp food down at an unmanageable rate! Best of luck :-)

Congrats on getting the treatment! Honestly the recovery road was pretty straightforward for me and everyone else has covered the most important advice. I will also say - try to refrain from overanalysing everything going on in your body and with your burp journey! It's very easy to get yourself into a state of convincing yourself things haven't worked right or that you're not making progress. Your progress towards burping probably won't be linear, and that's totally normal! Other than that, during the slow swallow phase I found that eating little and often was a good way to avoid too much discomfort - a full meal could take me 45 minutes or so to get through and I found it very hard not to gulp food down at my normal rate when I was super hungry, so smaller, more regular meals was a good approach for me. Happy burping!

I avoided fizzy drinks for the first 2 weeks or so. Doesn't matter how much gas you're putting into your body, you're not going to be able to burp until the botox is fully active so I'd advise waiting until then!

Title    : 2 MONTHS POST BOTOX - starting to wear off... :-/
Selftext :
Hi all,

I'm now 8.5 weeks post-Botox and while I am still burping, I have felt a definite reduction in my ability to get the burps out quite so easily. I had posted a few weeks ago as I was already beginning to panic, but it was just a blip while I was ill with COVID, and ultimately the botox was still active so the burps were still coming fairly easy, just not as frequently.

The past few weeks have been fine - I've been trying to keep on the Shaker exercises here and there, although I must admit I wasn't doing them daily, so I've made much more of an effort this past week to do them at least a couple of times a day. I'm not sure how much they're helping but it seems worth sticking with! I have been drinking fizzy drinks sometimes too, but I'm so mentally scarred from the pain they used to cause me that I've found myself being overly cautious. Surprisingly coffee seems to be quite good at giving me burps so I've been practising with that. I did go out for drinks at the weekend and drank beer, which felt so nice because that had always been an absolute no-go!

Up until now I've mostly got the burps out by tilting my head down and turning it to the right - it literally feels like pushing a handle down and opening a door, which is quite satisfying, though I am now finding it harder. I then get all tense with the stress of not being able to burp as easily, which I'm sure isn't helping! I have managed to get some burps out without turning which is positive, though I am now concerned that I should've practised this more over the past month.

I just wanted to hear from other people who've had the botox and how they manage to get over the 2-4 month struggle. I have had a very slight return of some of the previous bloating symptoms on the days where I've found it harder to burp and I find it very anxiety-inducing - being able to burp has improved my quality of life SO much and I am desperate not to go back to all of that! Of course I would consider getting the treatment again if I really needed to, but it's a really long way for me to go and a lot of money, so I really hope I can capitalise on my first go and push through. I am also wondering - of those of who've had the botox and been successful, have you changed the way you get the burps out? Is it still possible to get them out by turning your head to the side or did you alter the way that you do it over time? And for those of you who needed a second treatment - how long did you wait before biting the bullet and getting the procedure again?

Thank you for this, it's really reassuring <3 

Do you now find that burping is easy/natural again? I assume it's never going to be quite as easy as when the botox is fully active, but does it get to a point where it once again no longer feels difficult and strained, as it does when the botox starts to wear off?

Hi all,

So I've had a pretty wonderful almost-4 months of burping, which has given me a new lease of life and made me so much happier and lighter! I've had a few blips here and there, but ultimately the Botox was still in effect so it was only ever a day or two of struggling to burp and then they'd always come back, although with slight diminishing returns as time has gone on.

I've now had a few days of struggling to get the burps out, and I know that Botox wise, I'm in the danger zone. Yesterday I drank a couple of beers and afterwards experienced my first taste of the horrible old symptoms that I used to deal with once or twice a week. Although they were nowhere near as bad (I think my general gut health is better as the botox gave my insides a chance to recover from a lifetime of noburp stress!), it was NOT fun to be reminded of that discomfort! I had had a long and busy day and I have found that those are the days that I struggle more, but all in all it is definitely getting more difficult, and I am concerned that it's just going to disappear altogether soon :-(

Now of course if I have to get the procedure again I absolutely will - it's been SO worth it, but equally I'd really rather not as Lucy Hicklin's clinic is a long way plus it's a lot of money to me! So I've been doubling down on my Shaker exercises - I had been really good at doing them every day for a few weeks around the 2 month mark, but I fell out of the habit for a solid week or so when I went on holiday a t the beginning of the month. I've not really been drinking that much carbonation but I have still been trying to practice, as food and coffee are triggers. I just don't really love drinking fizzy drinks but I'm now starting to regret not pushing ahead with them more. I haven't got the hang of the forward-facing burp yet - I managed it for a while, but have still been relying on the head-tilt which is getting more difficult.

I'm wondering if it's now too late for me to push ahead with practising now that the Botox is so weak? I know a few people talk about it being really hard for a bit around this time and then it just suddenly becomes easier again, so I'm wondering how normal this all is, or am I just destined to struggle until it's all gone because I didn't practise enough?! Also for those who re-booked for a second procedure, when did you decide it was time to do that? Is there still hope for me to get round 1 working?!

It seems we are all on the same timeline! I'm just past the 4 month mark and have been experiencing a slight return of the symptoms, though admittedly nowhere near as painful or bad as before. I am still getting some burps pretty much every day - although they are frustratingly small and strained compared to how they were a month or so ago. It's like I can feel the muscle has tightened up and I just can't get the door open. I've emailed Lucy Hicklin for some advice, as it'd be great to know when I would have to start thinking about round 2 if indeed I can't keep the burps up, but looking on here it does also seem pretty common that they come back eventually. Not enjoying how strained I feel when I try at the moment :-( like I said, I'm still getting small ones most days, but I've definitely felt a bit more bloated and generally been more flatulent, which is so frustrating because I was really enjoying my unusually flat stomach and generally feeling more confident and 'normal' over Summer! I've been hitting the fizzy drinks when I can, but I hate that it sometimes backfires and I end up putting myself in pain.

Fingers crossed we can all get through this part as quickly and smoothly as possible!!

Title    : Booked in for Round 2 of Botox...
Selftext :
So after 3 months of wonderful strong burps and 2 months of strained but still relieving burps, the past couple of weeks have seen the Botox disappear from my system completely, and now I'm really struggling. After a couple of particularly miserable days where my noburp symptoms came back, I got really scared and saddened at the idea of returning to that life - so I booked in for round 2 with Lucy Hicklin in 3 weeks time. I am still holding out for a miracle in the next couple of weeks (the cancellation policy is pretty flexible), but equally I wanted to get booked in before Christmas just in case I don't see an improvement. By the time my appointment rolls around it will have been just over 6 months, so I guess I'll know for sure either way whether I'll need it?

I know lots of people on here have talked about the time around 5 months when the Botox wears off and how the burps disappear for a while before returning, and I was wondering how long this takes and for how long people struggled with the 5 month botox-free period. In all fairness, I am still burping every day, though for the past 2 weeks they have been really quite strained and often not very relieving (I have 1-2 very small strained burps after meals if I'm lucky, whereas when Botox was in effect I'd have 4-5 quite large burps). I have had a couple of bigger easy burps slip out recently and I'm wondering if this is a sign that things are improving with the muscle, but it's still not anywhere near how they were when the Botox was in full effect, and they kind of take me by surprise similarly to the very rare ones I would have pre-botox. 

So yes, if anyone has their experiences to share on this, I'd appreciate that. I'm still practising when I can and still doing my Shaker exercises, though should probably be doing more! I really don't want to have to get the Botox again as it's a ton of money for me, but I just can't go back to how things were!

hi there, so sorry for the slow response! so i went for the surgery a second time, and i'm pleased to say that this time around has felt even more effective. i no longer have to turn my head to get the burps out - i'm almost 3 months post-2nd dose and the burps are still pretty strong. they feel a lot more like 'normal', natural burps than they did the first time around. i'm praying that it sticks this time and starting to get on the fizzy drinks on a regular basis to keep it up, but yeah i would say it could be worth doing again because it really sucked to have the bloating symptoms return. another thing about the second dose is that the effects of the botox were so much quicker - i was back to burping pretty much the day after the procedure! i still had the annoying side effects, but that's all they were - just a bit annoying and not really too disruptive as i knew what to expect this time around.

i really REALLY hope it sticks this time because i can't afford a 3rd go, so fingers crossed!!

Hi, I‚Äôm a singer and have had the surgery twice. I just had the injection straight into the muscle without anaesthesia so I can‚Äôt comment on effects related to that procedure, but I guess it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be all that different in the long run.

Having the procedure definitely affected my singing ability, BUT I can assure you that it was only short term. I found it harder to control my voice or get as much power behind it as usual, and my vocal range was affected. This was at its worst for 1-4 weeks after the procedure and I basically had my full capability back by around week 8. 

This was one of my biggest concerns as a singer, but having had the procedure twice, I can tell you that the benefits FAR outweigh the temporary side effects. If I had to have it done again I absolutely would (although it has been over a year now so I‚Äôm happy to say that it seems to have stuck this time!). It has actually increased my confidence as a performer, because I would find my RCPD symptoms to be really exacerbated by nerves, so in the long term it has improved my singing abilities and allowed me to overcome a lot of fear. 

Hope you go for it, it has been genuinely life-changing for me :-)

It‚Äôs essentially the same thing, ie. an injection of Botox into the oesophageal sphincter. Some doctors do this with local anaesthetic whilst you are awake, others put you under and access the muscle through the mouth if this makes sense. The latter is supposed to be more accurate and failsafe. The local anaesthetic way is way quicker, cheaper, and fwiw was effective and accurate for me both times. In any case, obviously make sure you go with someone who has performed the procedure a lot. Now that the condition is becoming more well known, I would imagine that treatment is increasingly effective and safe.

My first procedure didn‚Äôt stick and I was so worried I‚Äôd just have to keep getting the Botox every time it wore off, but I‚Äôm happy to say that the second time stuck and I‚Äôm almost 2 years into my happy burping life post-2nd procedure. If I had to get it done again I absolutely would. I think I redoubled my efforts with the exercises and drinks the second time around which probably helped. I would say just do it - the symptoms are so miserable and the procedure really is the most straightforward way to get rid fast.

I sooooo hope you are lucky and only need it one more time like I did! ü§ûüèªü§ûüèª I remember deliberating a lot over having the procedure a second time, and I was so worried that it was going to be an ongoing cost if I needed it over and over again, but the relief once the Botox kicked in again was totally worth it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say just try and commit to spending 5-10 mins a day doing exercises/drinking fizzy pop once the Botox is in effect, it seemed to help me. Think I was so excited by the burping relief the first time around that I got complacent and forgot to do any ‚Äòpractice‚Äô! üòÖ

I remember being so freaked out by the idea of this before the procedure, but honestly in my experience it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. I do think some people struggle more than most, but I think that‚Äôs relatively rare, and once I‚Äôd got used to the sensation I found it easy enough to adapt. You‚Äôll find the foods that are easier and more challenging, and just make sure you have water handy at mealtimes. Also I found that I couldn‚Äôt do socialising while I ate for those weeks as I just needed to concentrate and take my time a bit more. One tip I wish I‚Äôd been given is to make sure not to wait until you‚Äôre absolutely starving hungry to start eating! I would find myself trying to wolf food down like I would normally and that obviously didn‚Äôt work üòÖ maybe you‚Äôll have more self control than me! But anyway it‚Äôs sooooo worth it once you‚Äôre through to the other side, so it helps to remember that during the difficult moments! God bless Dr Hicklin, I hope it‚Äôs all gone okay üôèüèª

Title    : New here. Do I have ‚Äòno burp‚Äô?
Selftext :
I‚Äôve just discovered this sub and identify with some stuff here.

I‚Äôm a 20 year old female, I have severe emetophobia, I have IBS, I haven‚Äôt thrown up since I was 8 (I don‚Äôt think I even can throw up- I barely did as a kid) and I burp only like once a year, always by accident and it‚Äôs always super quiet- like you wouldn‚Äôt even hear it if you were in the same room as me. I sometimes have exhales that feel like burps, that feel like releasing gas?

I have problems with farting very frequently and it‚Äôs also super super loud.

I don‚Äôt think not burping has ever caused me problems like the sub implies that it does for people. But if something could improve the issue of excessive and very loud farting then that would be very ideal.

I have read about the air vomit / gagging method, but I can‚Äôt do this because of my emetophobia. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm curious about it because I want to stop farting so frequently and so loudly.

If I‚Äôm going to attempt the method, I have 4.5 months. Because I currently have an en suite room in student halls and it‚Äôs noise cancelling enough that no one would hear me. In 4.5 months I‚Äôll be moving into a shared house with thin walls. I‚Äôm anxious about them hearing me farting- I‚Äôll be doing everything to prevent them hearing the farts. And I can‚Äôt be attempting the air vomit/ gagging method in the shared house because they will be concerned and think I‚Äôm throwing up. Also because of my emetophobia I have a fear of being watched/overheard while vomiting, so don‚Äôt want anyone to hear me gagging.

Do I have ‚Äòno burp‚Äô and should I want to cure it? I also fear my flatmates will think I‚Äôm bulimic if they hear me gagging all the time. How often are you supposed to do it?

Title    : Fear of turning into a burping machine is putting me off getting Botox
Selftext :
I just discovered I have this condition. My first post where I describe my symptoms is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/10ruf7u/new_here_do_i_have_no_burp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I have problems with loud flatulence. It‚Äôs super, super embarrassing. I want to get the Botox so it will stop. But I‚Äôve seen that people who get the Botox usually end up burping non-stop afterwards. I find the farting super embarrassing and I would feel the same way about burping if it was loud and uncontrollable. I didn‚Äôt grow up around ‚Äòtoilet humour‚Äô or the ‚Äòfarts and burps are funny‚Äô culture. Maybe it‚Äôs also because I‚Äôm female. I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm super embarrassed about it.

I want to get the Botox to stop the loud flatulence but I don‚Äôt just want to swap it for loud, frequent, uncontrollable burping. It would cause me such social anxiety. People who have had the Botox, can you make your burps quieter? I saw a guy say that he can burp with his mouth closed and then it‚Äôs pretty much silent.

Title    : Can I cure it without getting the Botox? I can‚Äôt afford it. Botox in the U.K.
Selftext :
I need to cure my R-CPD and ‚Äòget my burp back‚Äô (ideally to be able to burp like a normal person) so that the loud and frequent flatulence will stop. But I can‚Äôt afford the Botox. Is there another way? I newly discovered I have this condition.

Also where would I begin if I do decide to get the Botox here in the U.K.? I‚Äôm 20 and don‚Äôt really know how to go about these things. I‚Äôd probably end up going to Dr Lucy Hicklin in Chelsea in London. I think she does the Botox without putting you to sleep for ¬£850. I saw a positive review from someone on tiktok. Am I supposed to go through my GP first? Get referred to a local ENT? 

I‚Äôm moving into a shared house (small house with thin walls!) in 4.5 months and so need to have the loud flatulence cured by then!

About 5 years ago I had problems with my singing voice involving reduced vocal range, and poor technique/placement due to my muscles in my larynx playing up. I was diagnosed by an ENT with muscle tension dysphonia- tension and inflammation in the larynx. Despite having vocal therapy (blowing bubbles into water with a straw, vocal exercises etc) this condition has not totally improved. I now wonder if my dysfunctional oesophageal sphincter due to no-burp may play a part

Title    : Dr Verma - cost
Selftext :
I have the surgery scheduled for a few weeks from now with Dr. Verma in Irvine, CA - I have Cigna insurance and I‚Äôve been quoted about $1800 total for surgery + Botox + anesthesia fees. 

Is anyone in a comparable situation? Their office billing dept was kinda wishy washy about costs at first (quoted me diff prices and seemed to be unsure of things overall), but I know CA has that new transparency act... I‚Äôve just been burned before with medical costs. Overall excited about getting the Botox, but still nervous. Thanks!

Title    : 24 hour post op play by play
Selftext :
It‚Äôs officially been 24 hours since I got Botox. Here are my ramblings.

Hours 0-8 after procedure: 

Regretting everything (I‚Äôm being dramatic but after the procedure was rough until I fell asleep)
Strep throat feeling, my body was kind of sore, heavy mucus from being intubated (I was put under general anesthesia) was choking me and causing me to cough which‚Ä¶ hurt
I was able to sleep most of the night sitting up! 

Hours 9+: 

When I woke up this morning, I had far less mucus than last night which I‚Äôm so thankful for. I still had that sort of strep throat pain in my throat.. maybe even worse than yesterday

After my partner crushed up some ibuprofen and I took it in a little shot glass with juice my pain started going down 

Hour 20: My first micro burp!!!

Hour 22: My second micro burp!!!

Hour 23: My third micro burp!!!

Hour 24: Currently feeling some cuts on the side of my tongue that hurt a bit from the procedure. My throat is sore, but better than yesterday for sureee. I‚Äôve been using AI on my phone to talk and communicate with my partner on what I need. Only slight mucus. 

Tips:

My drive home was two hours and probably the worst drive of my life for both my wife and I üòÖ I almost threw up 3 times. She was driving and hates the sound or sight of anyone throwing up so I was so nervous. We both were lol 
So I guess maybe if I could do it again I‚Äôd get a hotel room after that‚Äôs nearby the surgical center. HOWEVER, I loved being able to feel miserable at my own home once we finally did get home so yeah idk 

Also regret not getting liquid Tylenol beforehand. If you‚Äôre anything like me, pills will be very hard to swallow post op. But my wife got some today so all good there 

I‚Äôve only been eating soup (warm NOT hot) for the past 24 hours and drinking an electrolyte drink that‚Äôs mostly water. 
Hopeful by tonight that I‚Äôll be able to eat something else like apple sauce

Title    : Advice
Selftext :
I live in Sydney, Australia and have seen many doctors for constant nausea which has contributed to a lot of anxiety and social situation avoidance. I also mention that I have not burped in years, and when I try, a gas bubble feels like its stuck in my throat. They always treat me for acid reflux and prescribe antacids, which only help for barely 5 minutes. After that, the air stuck in my throat is still there and tends to get worse. This tends to make me feel nauseous all throughout the day which is troublesome because I am afraid to vomit or gag, I can‚Äôt the last time I vomited. 

I am unsure what to do next. I know there is a doctor treating this condition but he lives in the US, my parents definitely will not let me travel there since I am only 16. I tried one neck exercise for a bit but it didn‚Äôt really seem to work. Anyone got any suggestions?

I have told many different doctors many different times about my inability to burp. They have all attributed this to GERD (chronic heartburn), which i feel is actually a consequence of my inability to burp rather than a cause.

Title    : Microburped/burped without botox
Selftext :
Hey guys, had to thank God after I microburped last Wednesday after tons of shaker exercises and proper posture. I really hope this continues to improve to bigger burps but so far I have found the following to be quite useful:

1. Doing shaker exercises (i just did 3 reps, held about 50 secs each time, 3 times daily) If it gets easy try placing a weight on ur forehead and/or pushing down to apply pressure and make exercise more difficult
Also this exercise which i will attach the link to later (remind me in a comment pls)

2.Learning the mechanics of burping
For me what worked was either turning your head to the left or pushing ur head slightly forward whilst keeping ur body back. Relax your shoulders. Then someone on this subreddit said to imagine ur singing a very deep sound but u dont actually need to make the sound. Just get ur throat in that position.

3.When u feel a gas bubble about to come up, then get into this position immediately (2). U should feel a bit of air escaping and a strange taste at the back of ur mouth

Title    : How to go from microburps to bigger burps
Selftext :
Have been able to micro-burp when turning head to the side or pushing neck forward. Also, after eating when there is some gas I can turn my head to the side and about 20% of the time, there is a small release of air when the gas bubble comes up and I can taste it at the back of my mouth. Does anyone with or without botox have any tips on what to do from here? These microburps are good in that they get rid of air trapped in the throat area but I still feel pretty bloated during and after meals.

Title    : How to overcome emetophobia
Selftext :
It seems that a common trend of noburpers is that they also have emetophobia. In fact, I believe it is the emetophobia developed from a traumatic incident of vomiting as a child that deters us from letting anything come up through the mouth again and hence, noburp. This was true for me. I am curious to see if anyone on this forum has actually overcome this fear, either by using a different way of thinking or through physical methods. For me, emetophobia has made me very socially anxious and  made me reluctant to eat much at times, particularly before exams or outings with friends. I really need help with this as I plan on getting a job and do not plan on embaressing myself or losing weight rapidly from not eating much.

my procedure is tomorrow (with my gastroenterologist) after thousands of dollars and two years of tests to rule out everything from systemic sclerosis to anxiety.  Turns out i have nerve/spinal signaling issues and the ONLY option at this point is to either become a Valium zombie or get the botox. With insurance, after hitting my deductible, the procedure will cost $1K out of pocket. I don't even care about the cost at this point, I just want relief. I'm excited, but also nervous about "slow swallowing" (or whatever that is) afterward.  I hope this works and I hope it's worth it!

Title    : Bummed out...
Selftext :
Today I went in for a botox injection and it got changed at the last minute to a dilation because the surgeon wasn't comfortable doing the crycopharangeal botox injection. Dilation is where they knock you out and stretch the UES as much as possible. I don't see how this would have any permanence on a sphincter muscle that is hypertensive. 
Needless to say... I'm not a happy camper. Who knows if it has worked as well as the botox would have. Supposedly it should work and comes with less risk. I've spent so much f-ing money to get to this point and I am so frustrated. This is another $1K for an "it might work" situation. I want to scream!!!!!

i only had discomfort the first 2 days after.  So far, with only dilation, i have tiny gurgle burps coming up, but big ones still get stuck.  My problem comes from crycopharangeal spasms from neurological/nerve-related issues. So, this is why I was not thrilled with only having dilation. It's not going to stop the spasming, thus likely undoing any progress in a few weeks when the stretched area goes back to "normal."

The anesthesiologist monitors you the entire time you are out and adjusts if needed, but you should always tell him/her about weed usage prior to getting knocked out.

I second the air vomiting method. it gets easier to do with fewer "accidents" as you get used to how to do it. Usually for me, I start with a cough and also make the H sound as i breath out.

you will be fine as long as you are not Taylor Swift -- you may not end up on key so close to post-op

I don't make stomach acid with a low enough ph to properly break my food down. Found via medical test with ph sensor pinned in lower esophagus for days.

Yes. I had a manometry that also showed a dysfunctional esophagus. It's not achalasia because my lower esophageal sphincter doesn't close. Fun stuff.

it's still the same... cannabis helps greatly.  
Doc wanted to cut the UES so I can burp and have fewer incidents of choking on nothing.  I am afraid to do that as it is permanent and you can aspirate your food at any point after.  Yikes. Imagine mot being able to control regurgitation and then suffocating.
