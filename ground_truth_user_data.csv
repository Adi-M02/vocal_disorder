my symptoms are they dangerous so i m 17 and i havent been able to burp my whole life except as a baby sometimes i ll burp like once a year but i dont mean to i dont usually have bloating but sometimes when i do gurgle i will get chest pain what lasts a few seconds then goes away n then i feel fine does anyone else get this i dont think its acid reflux as when i never gurgle i never get these chest pains these chest pains dont happen every time i gurgle but do happen sometimes when i do gurgle it is annoying as it is uncomfortable but i would love to know if this is dangerous or just something what is very annoying and another question how do you lot deal with the gurgles if you are at college or work cos i usually relief mine at home when i lie down but i dont know what to do when i m at college so it s nothing bad and thank you i was amazed when i found this subreddit i have been to the doctors but he just said if it gets worse then take gaviscon so it mustn t be too bad thing is before i went to the doctors i was really worrying about it but then after i went to the doctors i ve felt better and feel like the chest pains havent been as bad as they have been so maybe i could ve had minor health anxiety and me thinking about it may of made it worse than usual thanks man it s just very annoying to have it strange isnt it but thank you man you ve made me feel alot better about this whole thing not burping doesn t really bother me tbh i have some ways what can relieve it but thank you for the advice it s something i will take into consideration if it get worse absolutely it s so strange health anxiety it s like your body just wants you to feel terrible if you re out try chewing some gum that usually has some temporary relief of the gurgles n just eating slower and taking smaller sips can help must ve been annoying to have it all your life air vomiting what are your experiences with air vomiting how much of a life saver actually is it and how do i do it sorry but how do you scratch your throat is it by catching it with your nails when u put it fingers down there or what i ve started doing the shaker exercise for the last 2 weeks or so i ve not really had any luck with it yet i ll just have to keep going and hope for the best can it be the same concept if theres air stuck in the chest thank you so much i ll try it i ll keep trying yeah i get this all the time mine give me some chest pain sometimes but not all the time lying down on my back helps alot acid reflux can be a symptom of not being able to burp there are some exercises you can do which are meant to relax your ues and some people have been able to burp from doing it cricoid massage shaker exercise also some people air vomit or kinda of like beat the throat to try and force air out but i dont do this everyone has their own symptoms for this we ve just got to live on i m afraid unless you get treatment try the shaker exercise and see how it goes and keep trying it cos you never know it could work omg i kinda get this too gurgles what sound like a burp but doesn t feel like one that s incredible how are you doing at the moment i m curious for the future of us no burpers medically wise i m curious to know if in the future this will be a recognised thing and that it s something that every doctor will know how to do will there be different procedures will it cost anything will most doctors be able to do it i m so curious surely medically wise this is going to get better in the future right tbh i m young so i m just waiting for the future and i will most likely get it in the future i just hope its something i dont have to save up alot for and also travel alot for hopefully it s near my closest hospital one day hey so after the 3 weeks or so i was doing the shaker exercise i stopped for 2 weeks because i felt like it wasnt working i ve started doing it again like 3 or 4 days ago and i ve been having so many micro burps it s been amazing so i m gonna keep going i think i ve had about 10 micro burps today yeah every day i started doing the 30 neck lift up things and it seems to be working abit i m micro burping alot lately i can burp now kinda no botox so it all started a couple weeks back when i started trying the shaker exercise i did this every day for 3 weeks or so and didnt get much luck probably a micro burp every 2 or 3 days so i decided to stop as i didnt think it was working but then 3 days ago i thought let s try it again so i started doing the shaker exercise again and along with the 30 neck crunches exercise and now i m micro burping so much its unbelievable i feel like each day they re getting more forceful so i m gonna carry on doing these exercises and hopefully i can strengthen them so far i ve dont 30 microburps today with 2 being quite loud has anyone got any tips on how i could strengthen them n make them more louder and more powerful yes i taste the micro burps most of them come from drinking fizzy drinks and yes i do taste them thanks i still have gurgles sometimes but i m having a lot of burps may need more time so my body can get used to the burps and hopefully keep the ability i m so happy how did it go that s great good luck to you serious question about once you ve learned to burp if you taught yourself how to burp by doing the shaker exercise and other exercises what are the chances of losing the ability to burp once you gained that ability by exercises you know the shaker exercise how you lift your neck so your chin touches your chest instead of holding it just keep lifting your neck up and down so your chest touches your chest and repeat it 20-30 times how are you doing now so you probably wont lose it then hey just wanted to say i can official burp now those exercises do indeed work may need some time anyone got any answers so i ve just recently learned how to burp and have been having abit of problems with reflux nothing major as gaviscon easily solves it but does anyone know why i ve been having more reflux than usual also regurgitated a little bit lately too hows your heartburn been and how did you deal with the regurgitation oh my god i just found this group and omg ive never heard of anyone else who gets the gurgle oh my god i cant believe im not alone gosh i literally had to double check i didn t write this post because it is the exact same stuff i have gone through as well and i only found this group yesterday i m going to book an appointment with my gp on monday but i m not too hopeful as from this subreddit we clearly aren t known about too much i ve spent all day compiling sources and papers and articles and everything i can find to prove to my gp that this needs to be taken seriously and since my gurgling has been unbearable today i ve recorded all the sounds to show them i ve also had this for as long as i can remember but i m now having to force myself to vomit multiple times a day and it s just wrecking my quality of life hope you get the answers you need and please keep posting because as a very very poor student in the same boat i ll need all the advice i can get amazing news ahhhh i ve struggled with rcpd for as long as i can remember but it has recently become unbearable the other night i couldn t cope anymore i was making myself sick up to ten times a day just to release some air it was awful so i finally decided to bite the bullet and email around every local private ent with special interest in laryngology and this morning i heard back from one saying he would love to help me out he can see me this week as a private patient or in a few months as an nhs patient and his fees are so much less than mr karagama by the looks of it so i might actually be able to scrape together enough money from savings and student finance to get it done itll mean i can t get a car quite so soon but a small price to pay to be able to burp lil update i am speaking to my gp on tuesday for the referral if they say no the ent surgeon who will do the procedure has said he will write to them explaining the procedure and how it is affecting my quality of life and i will just keep trying not a great message lol but i will not take no for an answer at this point the gp has no idea how it s affecting my quality of life so if they say no then i will just try another gp until someone takes it seriously i was a little optimistic in this first post just overwhelmingly excited to have made some sort of progress after so long but my life is pretty shitty at this point because of it i can t eat big meals i am losing so much weight because of that i can t have drinks with friends because alcohol sets me off hugely i have ended relationships because it was so embarrassing having meals with someone and them asking what it was and the other day someone asked me what that noise was when i was on the phone with them i will keep you all updated i got the referral i was expecting so much resistance but he said i had clearly done my research i came armed with a named surgeon who wanted to do help statistics papers etc and didn t even ask questions or made me feel shit he just referred me i m a medic so i think that helped my confidence in approaching him with using proper medical jargon so maybe he took me more seriously so my advice is just compile the data and go for it and if it doesn t work the first time try and try and try again im the exact same it has plagued me my entire life and i thought i was completely alone then about a month ago i found this group armed myself with evidence that i am actually suffering and went to my doctor i ve been referred to a laryngologist for the botox procedure life after botox i was recently referred to a laryngologist for the botox procedure but since it s on the nhs it ll be a while before i actually get seen i m curious what people have noticed after botox very niche question but will it affect my voice i d love if it made me a better singer that d be a lovely little bonus omg video please did you vomit as a child at all i ve just read a post here about getting rcpd after vomiting which made me thing i never vomited as a child i vomited when i was 5 and then didn t vomit again till i was 17 because i had norovirus i m 22 now and still can t vomit or burp obviously unless i am incredibly drunk and then i guess i m relaxed enough to force it myself but again it never comes naturally could that have been because of this i ve had rcpd for as long as i can remember my mum remembers me gurgling and bloating when i was a kid so could that have been why i physically couldn t vomit as a child inflammation of the oesophagus with eosinophilic infiltrates they re normal blood cells that we all have but they can be raised in things like eosinophilic asthma and certain infections both of my parents can could burp completely fine could because my dad has passed not because he stopped being able to so weird - i wonder if it s related at all if i vomit now i definitely have to force myself to do it lol tb to messy nights out it definitely doesn t come naturally i wonder if it s all to do with not being able to relax your throat enough to let anything out let alone air i m not even a singer or have ever claimed to be i just think how cool of a side effect would it be if i went from a bang average singer to having the voice of an angel contribute to doctors understanding of rcpd i ll comment the info about it below there s this website which is aiming to build a database from patients of every single condition i ve used it before to answer questions about some other conditions but it has only just occurred to me that rcpd might be on it too and they only need 29 more people to answer the survey for the rcpd forum to be up and running i m a medic and i ve already had lots of doctors refer to this website so getting the word out on here might be a really good idea to make this more known there s this website which is aiming to build a database from patients of every single condition i ve used it before to answer questions about some other conditions but it has only just occurred to me that rcpd might be on it too and they only need 29 more people to answer the survey for the rcpd forum to be up and running i m a medic and i ve already had lots of doctors refer to this website so getting the word out on here might be a really good idea to make this more known gosh i really really wonder if there s something in the fact that we are all either emetephobes or just very rarely vomited in childhood it would kinda make sense if we all had this mental block about being able to open up our throats to burp because we are all scared of vomiting i know that i have always tried to avoid burping when i was younger because a burp was always followed by vomit and i was so scared of vomiting now i d give anything to burp and i end up trying to force myself to vomit just to relieve the gurgling it would make sense tho as to why so many people are cured after the botox wears off we get over the mental block of burping so when the botox disappears the block is still gone oh god it wasn t easy but i emailed maybe 50 surgeons in my area yorkshire and then worked my way out from there and they all directed me to one surgeon who might be able to help it turns out he s done this surgery on one woman before so he was very happy to help again he told me to get a referral to him from my gp i think it helped massively that i already had a surgeon backing me up and who was willing to do the procedure oh my gosh i actually got emotional about this it ll probably be the best part of a year before i get the botox but just knowing i ve been referred to someone who will help is so so amazing omg i cannot wait for this to be me has anyone had a cricopharyngeal myotomy i had my clinic appointment and nasopharyngoscope yesterday which confirmed rcpd my surgeon recommended the myotomy procedure has anyone had it and what did it involve how was your no-burping after i m so excited i cried on the way home because i ll finally be able to get my life back and socialise with my friends new here question about hiccups hi everyone i m new here i m a 28 year old woman and i ve never been able to burp every now and then i have what i like to call baby burps that really aren t burps at all but just a little air that comes out still the worst part for me is the hiccups i get horribly painful hiccups for prolonged periods of time i ve recently learned of this subreddit and of r-cpd and was curious if anyone knows if bad hiccups are part of this condition or if it s just me oh wow thank you that was super helpful has anyone used a doctor in nyc looking into botox but i live in nj right near nyc so flying out to dr bastian is an option but not a preferable one wondering if anyone had any success with doctors in the nj ny pa ct area i m so glad you shared this i live in nj and have considered going into nyc to get the botox done i live right on the border of nj and nyc so it s very convenience but i am worried about going to a doctor that isn t dr bastian since i ve heard so many great things this really confirmed that he might be the right choice i am a 28 year old woman and have never been able to burp get painful hiccups frequently and can t drink anything carbonated i didn t even know there were others like me until two weeks ago when i found this subreddit and learned of dr bastian i m glad you got your botox young i do have a question though what was the surgery like did you have go to under anesthesia i know you said your throat was sore for a few days but was there any other pain side effects also what was the process like with dr bastian sorry i know i ask a lot of questions lol yes thank you out of curiosity you said the botox lasts 3 months is the idea that you get the botox once or twice and then you retain the ability to burp forever or do you need to keep getting botox every x amount of time thanks so much i d love it if you could keep me posted in the next few weeks how post-op is going i ve thought about this surgery so much and just don t know if it s worth it maybe you can answer my questions 1 how does the surgery work exactly do they cut you open are you put under anesthesia or are you awake 2 how long is the recovery time 3 what was the process like particularly prior to surgery how was dr bastian 4 how is it now can you control when the burps come out i know you said it was life changing but more specifically - like what are the feelings now do you get any of those same pains or gurgling noises sometimes sorry i know it s a lot of questions but it s something i m considering and don t want to go into it blind i d want to see dr bastian but i know he s in chicago and i m in nj so i d have to fly out to see him and want to make sure it s worth it wow that was an amazing insight into the process - thank you so much for that i ll look into the post op journals and other people who have worked with dr bastian thanks again happy burping has anyone had any negative side effects from the botox procedure but you feel like the procedure really helped i m just trying to figure out if it s something i should do but i like to know other people s opinions and experiences it s funny though because right now i basically throw up when my noburps get bad so i d basically be in the same situation lol i basically just throw up bubbles it s the only way to relieve the sensation but throwing up hurts a lot and i usually end up bursting a bunch of blood vessels in my face so it looks like i have a bunch of dark freckles ugh i have my date for throatox i hope others also call it throatox because it s such a good name for it getting it done mid-feb i know my consultant will go through it all with me but what can i expect from the op itself and the recovery so excited i m having my botox in chesterfield next week and i m also my surgeons first rcpd pt i won t lie i m quite nervous about being his first but i m also telling myself that although the condition is new to him he s done throatox tons of times so it ll be okay i m getting my botox done in chesterfield next week took three years of waiting primarily due to covid but the days almost here questions about air vomiting chest pains after drinking alcohol so all my life i ve struggled with not being able to burp just get gurgling noises that provide no relief also very scared of vomitting and last time was about 10 years ago when i drink alcohol i normally have lemonade as mixer or something carbonated i find that after drinking a few i get really intense chest pains and i feel so full that i can t bear to drink anymore normally before i m even drunk so drinking out is a pain just now i had been out and had like a drink per hour and twice i had suddenly felt very hot mouth started salivating and then had to air vomit but i don t even know if this is what s happening i just like gag and nothing comes out but it doesn t seem like air is coming out either can you feel it but i immediately feel better after doing it it s so weird and embarrassing i had to leave suddenly to the bathroom as within a minute i suddenly felt this way and did this motion about 3 times then felt completely fine is this air vomitting or what is it am i just sick from alcohol but idk because when i drink at home i use a lot less lemonade and stir it a lot so there s not much carbonation and i can actually get drunk before feeling the chest pain sickness i still have chest pains after the air vomits it doesnt go away just takes time to wear off is this pain related to rcpd or something else thanks all for any help hmm interesting yeah it doesn t really sound like much idk i guess i kind of try hold back because i m afraid of being actually sick normally it s like a gag cough choke kind of i don t really know how to explain it there s a little noise but not super loud so maybe this isn t air vomitting or perhaps just partially maybe i can t make the proper motion of vomiting when i get sick it s awful because i can t vomit i just heave and heave cos i literally don t know how to force it out i feel this is exact as i had it too i just gag and instantly feel better it s so odd throatox day currently sat on the day case pre-op unit waiting to go down to theatre 100 units of botox going in turns out my surgeon is very good friends with mr karagama so he s been getting lots of info about it from him aaaaahhhh i m excited now i m having mine done today by mr olarinde in chesterfield he s mr karagama s good friend and fellow ent surgeon tongue numbness after surgery did anyone experience numbness of the tongue after surgery i m a medic myself so i know the fancy name for it is post-operative lingual neuropraxia but the papers i ve read don t say how likely it is to recover apparently it s much more common in head and neck surgery so it does make sense but i don t really want a numb tongue so has anyone had this and had it go away ps i m currently 5 hours post-botox so very early stages but i ve had a lot of nerve damage from previous surgeries so i m a bit anxious hi i had my botox 5 hours ago and have the exact same thing right side of my tongue is numb did yours resolve oh thank god thank you so much i ve had lots of nerve damage from surgeries last year all orthopaedic and it never returned so i was scared there was no hope good thank you i stretched in bed this morning and i guess the pressure of tending my stomach forced a huge burp to come out a few tiny burps this morning slipping through so doing well my tongue is numb unfortunately but i think that s just the anaesthetic intubation tube that was resting on it and caused numbness but everything i ve read has said it should slowly come back no reflux but definitely the slow swallow i m getting quite a lot of gurgling still and i m not able to turn them all into burps but hopefully they ll transition in the next few weeks i emailed mr olarinde in chesterfield my most local at the time was a long wait mainly covid but i got my botox done yesterday should add this was all on the nhs i emailed about 2 ent surgeons around the country and he was interested and keen to help day 1 post-botox questions i had 100units injected yesterday since then i ve had 2 burps big for me but for someone who doesn t have rcpd they d probably consider them small burps i ve got a lot of gargling still going on though i m sure i m just being impatient but when do i learn to properly burp i feel like i now have all the tools to do it but i can t force them out yet the tiny burps just spring up on me but i can t turn them into anything big yet is this normal oh good i won t lie i think my numbness is already disappearing it might be wishful thinking but it s a lot less obvious than it was on day 1 when do you start being able to control burping post-botox i m day 2 post-botox now and am having lots of uncontrollable burps which is amazing but i do have to go back to work on day 6 post-botox and i m a bit conscious of burping uncontrollably when do they start to lessen or when am i possibly able to control them a bit more thanks i m d3 post-op at the moment and the slow swallow and mucus is actually really scary i get paranoid that i m choking and start panicking how long did this last for you i emailed about 20 different ent surgeons with special interest in laryngology and he replied saying he was keen to help he d never heard of the condition before this was 3 years ago but said he would read up about it and learn the botox technique and three years later here i am i have only had one round but mine was 100 units i m day 6 post-botox now and the slow swallow is terrible i get stuck on every single bite and need to wash it all down with water but even water can be hard today is the first day that it s better but omg it s the worst and scariest sensation i ve ever experienced totally normal i m day 6 post-botox and this is exactly what i have been like for the past week i have had to sleep with three pillows like i m sat up in a chair today is the first day where i m feeling a bit better though if my worst day was a 10 today is maybe a 6 in terms of severity i m able to control the burps a bit more now i m having to talk less than usual from fear of some sneaking out in public but that s not been an issue at all i m also so much more comfortable today my throat neck has felt so tight for the past week but today i m a lot more relaxed stick it out not that you have a choice lol i drove home 3hrs the day after my ga exactly 24h later the strong coffee was needed though i m day 6 now and this is the first day i ve started to feel somewhat better even yesterday day 5 i was so miserable and uncomfortable my neck felt so tight and tense i m d9 post-op now and i d say i m about 60 back to normal had to learn to abdominal thrust myself but can t believe how different my tummy throat gurgles feel hahah wine actually bloated me hugely pre-botox i exclusively drank cranberry juice x spirits i can t even remember how long it took to come back because it s completely back to normal think it was about 6 weeks all motor and sensory function has returned and it s like it never happened worried my botox hasn t worked day 3 hi everyone i had botox a couple days ago with lucy hicklin in the uk after the procedure i had a bit of tenderness and soreness but overall felt fine i was gurgling quite a lot right after and was hoping one of them would magically turn into a burp but no nothing cus how amazing would that be if not even an hr later i had already burped i can eat just fine too no slow swallowing etc so it s now morning day 3 and i m soo paranoid that it s not worked because i m not feeling any side effects even if i don t have any side effects could it still be working i don t really understand it cos i had been reading up others experienced and some burped few days after some a week some more does the botox need time to kick in or something if i had a really tight throat would a higher dosage of botox be needed and so this dosage might not do anything i d been hoping so much that this would help some of my issues as it s getting really bad lately and i will be so upset if i have done it all for nothing how long would i have to wait til i can get more injected any advise or reassurance is welcome please thank you all ah nice yes maybe i saw you haha do you have to wait a couple months after the initial botox to have a new injection thank you i definitely was just panicking i have actually had some micro burps since this post so yay i wasn t aware that it takes a few days to start taking effect tbh 2 weeks post botox with lucy hicklin 1st dose hi i wrote a small diary for my side effects after botox with lucy hicklin at the centre in chelsea if anyone is interested i posted a few weeks ago worried it wasn t working at all but i did manage to get some micro burps and large burps since i feel like by the end of the 1st week it seemed to be at the peak and i had a few large burps but mostly i only had micro burps i also can only burp when i move my head to the right and lean downwards as if i was sniffing my armpit which is a little bit awkward in public and at work so i m too afraid to do it moving my head about side to side i can find the sweet spot sometimes and continuously moving my head into that spot makes the air come out it s a bit strange i haven t really managed to burp any other way i have coughed yawned a couple times and a burp kind of came with it but that s about it i d say i ve had less than 10 large burps where i truly felt my throat open and pass the air also tasted it lol feeling a bit sad that it seems to be wearing off rather than improving so i m hoping that a 2nd higher dosage will give greater results as it s clear this injection worked slightly but maybe not quite enough 14 08 2023 day 1 - procedure was ok very nervous for it injection was uncomfortable but not too painful tiny prick upon needle entering then full feeling as the botox was injected throat felt full like a lump stuck felt a bit light headed afterwards throat remained feeling full and like a lump is there swallowing felt a little different and sore turning my head neck felt a little sensitive when laying down and talking on the phone my voice felt a little different kind of wobbly day 2 - feel completely fine no different at all eating fine day 3 - same as day 2 when i woke up but throughout the day my swallowing seems a bit slower like something stuck in my throat food seemed to get stuck in throat too but not near choking just like something a little stuck where when you swallow so many times the feeling still stays also a little bruising towards left of the centre of my neck day 4 - slow swallowing when eating a few micro burps feeling like there is a bit more trapped air that isn t turning to gurgles which provided a little relief so it s a bit uncomfy turned head to right side and lowered head a bit to chest shoulders managed to do 3 micro burps like this but there s not loads of relief day 5 - still slow swallowing i can do micro burps by lifting up my arm opening my mouth and pushing my head towards my armpit like i m sniffing it then little burps come out but they re so tiny and quiet i videod this discovered it accidentally after i sniffed my armpit and a burp came out lmao not sure if they re providing much relief i do feel a bit less bloated but could just be placebo effect day 6 - same as before burping by turning my head and facing down did 2 quite big burps i was sitting in the car and turning my head these burps had a taste and felt quite forceful so i know they were proper felt like my throat was opening up 20 08 23 day 7 - just micro burps using the head position no big burps sadly my stomach pains seem to not be as often constant which is good had a few large burps between these time most of the time still micro 24 08 23 - feel like i was not burping so much today i had a few small ones and a big one but alot of gurgles hope not going backwards 27 08 23 - not much burping more gassy and stomach pains 31 08 23 - same as above feel like not doing much burping still gurgling i can pass small amounts of air but larger gurgles get stuck and don t seem to pass sometimes i will gurgle burp at the same time i can feel everything i can feel when it s coming up about to release and sometimes it just gets stuck as it s about to and turns into a gurgle hope this is helpful for anyone i just made a post https www reddit com r noburp comments 166dyr0 2 weeks post botox with lucy hicklin 1st dose utm source share utm medium android app utm name androidcss utm term 1 utm content 1 about my experience after 2 weeks by 7th day i had micro burps and experienced a couple large burps have you tried experimenting with head positions when you feel the urge to release the air especially after eating drinking try turning it left right down up could maybe have some success there i had botox and the first couple weeks after i was able to micro burp but not fully burp sadly it s worn off now and am planning my 2nd dose but while it was in effect i definitely felt my stomach issues were much better i regularly have all the mentioned issues stomach pain usually after eating anything at all doesn t matter what bloating excess wind going to the toilet too often etc i m hoping my 2nd dose will allow me to burp properly and hopefully these issues will go away too i noticed when doing exercises that compress my stomach area i get a lot of throat gurgles and it s really uncomfortable had to stop the other day as it just didn t feel good at all cardio seems to be fine for me but i only normally do fast incline walking when i had my first botox injection the slow swallow didn t start until day 4 and lasted 1-2 weeks i had micro burps and only a handful of proper burps unfortunately these stopped i will be going for 2nd injection in a few months too i get a lot of stomach pains especially in the morning like you say rn i have called off work cus it s that bad i have only had this level of pain 3-4 times in the past 2 yrs basically everyday i have a constant pain but the pain level fluctuates when i had my first botox injection worked for a short while but then stopped i did feel as though my stomach and pain was much better the annoying thing is that the issues could be from rcpd or it could be something else but until my rcpd is fixed it will be hard to tell what s causing what so i m getting a second injection and hoping it will help if my problems persist then it is most likely something else ibs food whatever and i will go to the doctor for tests my doctor s originally diagnosed me with ibs but it s hard to handle cos it seems some days certain foods trigger my pain and other days they don t so makes me think is it really that lots of rcpd sufferers get misdiagnosed with all sorts of stomach disorders yeah sadly i have a lot of trouble with swallowing pills do i couldn t take the medication prescribed when they suspected ibs they just prescribed something to eat before meals that calms the stomach apparently even though the tablet is tiny i still can t it s a mental thing for sure ah great yeah please do let me know thanks hope you get some answers tips for getting surgery i have only just realised that this problem i ve suffered with for years is no burp syndrome and i need to get throat botox to fix it i m so glad i finally have figured out what it is but i don t know what steps to take from here i went to my local gp and they just told me to keep a good diary and stay away from stuff that causes it which is everything so that wasn t helpful where do i go from here recommendations for botox procedure in nj nyc area hi everyone i m looking to get the botox procedure done to help with my r-cpd but i don t really know of any ents in my area who conduct the procedure is anyone in the new jersey new york area who might have a recommendation thanks this is interesting i have anxiety some gut issues and am overweight i have lost about 40 pounds over the last several years but i m still anywhere from 220-230 pounds depending on the day goal is 200 i find that it was easy for me to lose the first 40lbs because it was all a diet change but now that i ve been at a stable 230 for a while now and eating healthy and exercising daily i notice that i m actually having more trouble losing weight i also am having more rcpd symptoms than when i was at my heaviest bodies are so frickin weird i have been to lucy hicklin in london twice she mentioned dr karagama doing a different procedure where he is cutting the muscle it sounds like it might be more successful as it seems like a more permanent and sure method i hadn t heard of this before so i have no idea of the specifics though this is just what she mentioned to me maybe you could inquire with him he is based in london as well i have never heard of this might be best checking in with the person you had it done by cus it doesn t sound normal does this sound normal for burping after botox treatment pop feeling in my throat hi all so i got my 2nd botox about 2 months ago now i ve had loads of relief and burp alot however sometimes it seems really excessive when i burp i feel the air coming up and i breathe in feel a pop in my throat then i will immediately do a burp this is usually how it happens though sometimes the burps will just slip out and i don t breahhe in do the pop is this pop normal or is it me ingesting more air when breathing in and then immediately releasing it i do an excessive amount of burps and usually do massive burps about 50 times for an hour or longer after eating a meal this morning i woke up and was immediately burping without having even eaten anything why it s great to be able to burp but now it feels like a whole other issue has anyone else experienced this and does it wear off thank you is your throat still feeling uncomfortable i think i m going to be visiting her soon to get the procedure how long is it difficult to eat for also did it effect your voice sorry for all the questions one year on from throatox haven t been in this sub very much because as the caption states i m a year on from throatox but it popped up on my feed so i thought i d share i had throatox 100units february 2023 initial three weeks were rough and i won t lie i regretted it a bit first week i was just constantly choking no control over my swallowing so if i took an ambitious bite of anything i would choke i live alone so i had to get very good at throwing my back against the wall to dislodge the food bolus second and third weeks i started burping but had no control over it any time i opened my mouth to talk i d burp so i spent two weeks mute at work to save me the embarrassment but that s it once over the initial hump i have never looked back the no burpness feels like a distant memory i have complete control over my burps and haven t had a single throat gargle in a year i no longer get bloated this was the most amazing and unexpected effect literally haven t felt bloated in a whole year i can eat and drink whatever i like and hell the satisfaction of letting out a huge burp after eating has never worn off no regrets at all honestly has been life changing and would recommend throatox to anyone question about treatment i am 18 y o and i m doing my a-level exams in may and june i ve recently discovered dr hinklins treatment service and really want to get it but i am slightly worried that the side effects may cause issues with my studies i just wanted to ask for some opinions of people who have actually got the treatment do you think that the side effects would cause issues with my studies would it be better to wait until they re done thank you whoops yes i did mean dr hicklin thank you for the advice okay got it thank you just got my surgery two days ago and i had the same thing good news is i woke up today with waaay less soreness it goes away 2 days post-op general anesthesia procedure hi everyone i just got the botox injection with dr hayley born on monday it s wednesday now and wanted to get some advice from those who have had this procedure before i noticed yesterday that i started having these weird gurgle-y bubbly things come up in my throat after swallowing water or eating it s almost like there s air in there and it wants to come up but it s so mixed with saliva that it s all just a bubbly mess the problem i m having today is that it seems like it s doing it now even just when i m swallowing no food or drink i actually had to throw up a little bit to feel like i got some of it out and i haven t been able to lay down because it feels like it just stays in my throat and doesn t move down at all did any one else have an experience like this wow we re no burp twins lol thank you for this i was hoping i d have some more microburps without the liquid water mixed in but i guess i just have to be patient congrats on your procedure i hope this next week only gets better for you i just got the procedure with hayley born last week any tips or tricks to help with eating drinking did you have any regurgitation or acid reflux would love to hear how your recovery went i still haven t figured it out but think it s related to burping definitely my botox is wearing off a bit sometimes i do the pop noise but can t burp after but other times i do burp after maybe i need to get another injection oh that s interesting to note thanks for sharing i will keep in mind yep since i learned to burp from botox majority of the time i will feel a burp coming breathe in with a pop and then burp it s weird but it does relieve it but sometimes i will breathe in pop to burp but then the burp won t come out i have experienced that more lately which is why i thought my botox effects might be wearing off as i struggle to push the burp out a bit more often lucy hicklin pricing hi all just hoping to get some comments from people about what they ve been charged for by lucy for the procedure i had my initial botox done which was 850 for the consultation and the starting dosage of botox 1 injection in one part of the throat i then had a follow-up appointment which was my latest appointment back in november as i had no relief from this which i was advised would be 200 for the same dosage 1 injection or 250 for increase dosage 2 injections either side of the throat i just tried to book in again as i am still burping but feel them getting trapped sometimes and am worried i will soon not be able to burp and wanted to book in for a few months incase i started worsening she told me it would be 575 250 for the injection and the remaining is half of her consultation fee i was under the assumption any further doses would be 250 but now getting slapped with more than double the price i wondered if this is the norm anyone else had this thanks ah thanks i couldn t remember discussing it all as it was a while ago and assumed any follow-up injections would just be the price of botox only 250 but i guess she only offered this as a kindness to people who had no success with the injections ah true thank you i booked in just incase but probably cancel if i don t notice anymore of a decline in my burps i m monitoring it a bit more closely as i noticed the pains coming back they were basically all gone so just worried yeah when i first got my botox i was burping like mad almost too much it was annoying any little thing would make me burp alot and got hours but that s obviously not normal so maybe i am just expecting too much thank you fair enough i did ask for an explanation on the price and her secretary said it is half the cost of consultation but i can t see what there is to discuss i had the injection it s now worn off and can t burp again so want to do the same again as a top-up sorta thing sadly have to pay extra 300 or so just because of that yes i think that s what it is i didn t realise the 250 was just a generosity fee as it didn t work out so she just charge for the cost of the botox needle etc but as it s now worked the generosity discount is gone so i got to pay for the other bits at half the price makes sense now how long until i can sing hi guys i m getting my botox by lucy hicklin on the 19th august my band have been offered a good gig on the 29th august but i m the singer and don t know how the botox treatment affects the voice what do you guys think how is it now thank you that s great thanks for the response i will be awake for my procedure do you think there is a risk of vocal issues thank you is that normal though hope you re alright thank you wow okay thanks wow - guessing that s not normal hopefully it comes back soon thank you i know it changes from person to person but do you think i would be okay doing a gig on the 5th september if i get 50 units of botox on the 19th august 2 months post-op general anesthesia hey everyone i got the botox injection under general anesthesia 2 months ago now from dr hayley born in nyc and wanted to share some thoughts that would have helped me when i was considering the procedure please note that even my doctor told me that i was on a the higher side of adverse side effects from the procedure so please take this with a grain of salt - but i m someone who would have liked to have known all of the possibilities so i m sure some of you do too 1 general anesthesia general anesthesia was a great idea for me specifically because i wouldn t be able to go to the doctor s office several times to get the in-office injections whereas i could take a day off from work to have the outpatient procedure done and not have to come back to the office however i did end up having a reaction to the anesthesia for a couple of days where my entire body felt like i just done the most intense workout of my life especially in my calves abdomen and arms i seriously could not get out of bed without help because i couldn t use my abs to lift the top part of my body it went away after a couple days and apparently this is a common side effect of anesthesia but it had never happened to me and i ve had several surgeries so thought it was worth noting 2 regurgitation and slow swallow regurgitation this is something i had seen on this subreddit but i didn t really pay any mind to at the time this was a huge deal for me for about a month the problem with this specific injection of botox is that it basically paralyzes the muscle around the esophageal sphincter which helps air escape the muscle and come back up in the form of a burp it also comes back in the form of whatever you ve had to eat or drink phlegmy air bubbles i called them the gurglies the best way to describe this is having a lot of phlegm at the back of your throat but even after you clear it it just keeps coming back this was a scary one for me because i had never heard of anyone having these symptoms it would get in the way of my breathing through my mouth talking and eating slow swallow i know for a fact that some people did not experience this or did not experience it nearly as badly but i know some people do have this issue so i just want to explain what it s like so they know what s normal coughing fits where something just seems to get caught in your throat and nothing will clear it until you regurgitate or vomit and get whatever is stuck out this was super uncomfortable and made eating out at restaurants difficult i did in fact have this problem at a restaurant and it didn t end well i can t emphasize this enough drink water after all or almost all bites of food especially when you think you re starting to feel better you re going to get to a point where you think fuck it i can eat five bites of pasta before i need a sip of water but you do need it i promise it will help in addition to that listen to what your body is telling you if you ve eaten and gotten to a point where you can start to feel the food you ve eaten getting more and more stuck in your throat and needing more and more water to wash it down stop eating if it s so close to the surface and not going down smoothly there s a good chance you might regurgitate it and nothing feels worse than having to regurgitate food and wait until your next meal to eat 3 acid reflux speaking of eating wowza the acid reflux was a big problem for me here are the things i did to help eat less tomatoes tomato sauces eat more things high in fiber chickpeas potatoes broccoli whole grain bread smoothies etc elevate while sleeping no carbonated beverages - i know this feels like it defeats the purpose of getting the botox injection but the carbonation will not sit well in your stomach give your body some time to reach the plateau of the botox injection about a month to a month and a half and then you can go back carbonated beverages trust me you ll still burp in the meantime no alcohol if you re going to drink anyway do it in very small quantities and very infrequently ask your doctor if you should be taking anything like gaviscon or even famotidine forgive me if i m spelling that wrong to help with your reflux fam really helped me a lot but it takes a few days to start to work 4 sleep again this is one of those things that not everyone experienced but it was a big deal for me - sleeping because my regurgitation and acid reflux was so bad i was forced to sleep pretty much totally upright for almost 2 months at the month month and a half mark i noticed i would scootch down more and more every night to get comfortable and now i m only slightly elevated while sleeping i m glad i listened to my body and started reclining more when my body said it was okay with it 5 general tips bring water with you everywhere eat slowly and deliberately chew your food until it s paste work at your body s pace let your body tell you what it needs and can t have this is actually very important i thought that since i was having issues with slow swallow i should only eat soft foods but it turned out that soft foods just made it worse for me - it didn t slide down my throat like i would have liked so actually things that soaked up moisture worked better and then i could take a swig of water and it would go right down breads pastas tortilla chips were my lifesavers don t freak out if your journey is different than someone else s our bodies are all different and we experience side effects healing and medications all very differently talk to your doctor don t worry about feeling like you re asking too many questions - they are there to answer them and to help you get whatever help you need there s no such thing as stupid question 6 burping here s the good stuff burping is wild it feels good but gross and it s both happens on it s own and sometimes you have to force it the best way i can describe what a burp feels like is that it s like a airy vibration in your throat some things to note you can force a burp it doesn t just sit there causing you pain you sort of have to push your tongue down to the bottom of your mouth extend your neck a little bit and exert a little pressure from your throat muscles i also read from someone else on the subreddit that you can look to your left and look up and sometimes that helps too overall i m so glad i got this procedure done it sounds scary and there are a lot of moving parts to recovery at least there were for me but the fact that i can burp i m not bloated all the time i m not in pain my hiccups aren t nearly as frequent nor are they painful and i can eat drink whatever i want without feeling like i ll pay for it later -- it s such a freeing feeling i hope this helps someone it would have been great for me to know i wasn t alone in all of this at the beginning and that a lot of the things i was feeling were normal even if they were on the more extreme side of normal i wish everyone good luck on their journey may we all be burping the alphabet any day now great questions i m not actually sure the amount of botox i got but certainly more than you would get in the in-office procedure they can t give you that much in-office because they re going in kind of blind that s why they only do one side of your throat at a time - usually about 2-4 office visits are required but when they do general anesthesia they can see where they re poking so they can inject a much higher dose as for regurgitation the best way i can explain it is that unlike vomiting where it comes after nausea and is usually somewhat painful because your body is trying to push it out of your stomach regurgitation is more like there s nothing is blocking the stomach contents from coming up so it just sort of slides out the regurgitation itself can be different depending on what you re eating how long it s been since you ate what positions you re in if you didn t eat for a while but you had a sip of water only the water might come up and you can either spit it out or swallow it but if you have a coughing fit after you ve eaten you might kind of projectile whatever you ve just eaten i handled it by eating smaller portions eating slower and drinking water in between sips so nothing irritated my throat to make me cough but it could also just happen because of how you re positioned for example bending down was not really an option for me unless i did it the way pregnant women do bend down with your knees lean back and grab with your hand without bending over because stuff would just come up but on the whole i wouldn t let the regurgitation hold you back from doing it it s unpleasant for sure but the freedom and weight that is lifted by having done this procedure farrrr outweighs the negatives you just have to be cognizant of your limitations for a few weeks a lot of people don t even get regurgitation and much less people get it as bad as i had it i was definitely in the extreme camp hope that answers your questions well the good news is it ll be contained lol i would just bring a bowl with you while you scoop in case you need to cough anything up you can even sit down on the floor and clean that way keep in mind if you clean the litter boxes around when you first wake up before you eat or several hours after you eat you ll probably be able to bend like normal with nothing coming up it s only a problem when you have undigested food in your stomach oh no sorry to hear that mine stopped around week 4 and since then it s just been little things here and there if i over-eat or try to bend too soon after eating i still get the gurglies sometimes but much much much less my doctor explained to me that the height of the botox injection s effectiveness is basically between the first and the third week so once you hit that three to four week mark things start to get better it s a slow process and kind of a sucky one but i promise you it ll get better and you ll be happy you did the procedure even with the issues i will say that i don t really feel like my doctor walked me through all of the negative side effects as well as i think she should have all of my questions were answered honestly but i obviously would not have known to ask what s the regurgitation process like how long does it last and what can i do about it i feel she should have those answers already and provided it without me asking since it seems to be a big part of the healing process i hope you feel better soon if you have any other questions feel free to reach out here or in dms i wouldn t be worried at all i didn t have any microburps until about a week in i saw when i was looking for the same thing that some people didn t get microburps for like 2 or 3 weeks but the injection eventually did its job i d try forcing them a little when you think they re close to the surface i don t know if it helps at all or if it s psychological but i ve been able to force all of my burps out in due time even it takes like 10-15 minutes and i think it has to do with me associating the feeling of forcing it out with it happening i m not a doctor though so that might be bullshit lol did you get in-office injections or general anesthesia that s exactly what i did i thought the whole healing process was going to be easy and not at all a problem and then when it became harder and longer than i thought i started looking at everything online and couldn t find answers to my questions thats why i wanted to write this so maybe it helps someone in that situation understand the more realistic aspects of it but also to understand that it definitely does get better which is hard to hear when you re in it and it sucks haha i hope your issues clear up soon and i wish you a very speedy and healthy recovery i m always here if you have questions or need reassurance a month or so the first month i had the usual side effects and also burped far too frequently to the point it was just as annoying as not being able to burp i d just wake up and already be burping then eating food and i would burp for hours after every minute or so the good thing was that they never felt trapped but it was just far too much those burps were also very loud and powerful that eventually subsided and i m now at 6 months post-botox and i m still burping i do feel like sometimes they get trapped and it worries me but i think that is kind of normal my burps are nowhere near as loud big anymore they are quite quiet and small my stomach pains happen a bit more often compared to when i was burping so much but it s still nowhere near what it was when i couldn t burp at all everyday after eating at night when digesting food was when it was at it s worse so i d say 1-2 months before it feels normal surely yours wasn t done correctly thank you for your response i ve decided to take a bit of a risk and we ve booked a few gigs 3-4 weeks after the procedure worst comes to worst i ll just cancel i suppose lucky hicklin 2nd dose botox success hi all just wanted to update that i had my 2nd dose of botox back in november 2023 with lucy my first dose was unsuccesful my 2nd one i had 2 injections either side of the muscle and this worked really well i m still burping now and majority of painful side effects all gone get the ocassional trapped gas but i think that s just normal for everyone sometimes it s life changing best 1k i ve ever spent any questions i m happy to answer first time i had tiny microburps that gave no relief really so yea totally unsuccessful i d say first time i got the normal does 50 units 2nd time i got 100 units with 2 injections 1 either side of the muscle so first time i never really had any burps i mostly had microburps and that was it didn t get much relief had to turn my head into my armpit to squeeze the burps out too it was not good i did have 1 or 2 big burps but they were totally random and unexpected moments now i can feel it and push them out it s only because she is based in uk and we only have 2 options for treatment in the uk the only other option is dr karagama and he does surgery under anesthesia which is thousands of lucky hicklin does botox injections for about 800 on first appointment if doesn t succeed at all then she will do again for about 250 after anything else after that will be 575 so lucy hicklin will be the obvious choice for most uk people i m not sure about us doctors sorry yes worth it i had some more extreme side effects while the botox was still in my system but even with that i have felt so much better bloating is down way less gassy and just overall feeling lighter and better i actually wrote a 2 month post op post check it out here tl dr recovery was hard in some ways but mostly because i ended up getting pretty much every side effect you can get from the procedure overall now almost 5 months post-op i m very happy i did it i burp a lot now bloating is way down painful hiccups are gone etc i wish you the best of the luck feel free to reach out with any additional questions https www reddit com r noburp s ezazccwog5 are your burps now controlled or are they still out of nowhere i m a bit concerned about the social aspect of randomly burping post-botox diary - success i had 50 units from dr hicklin on monday here is my diary so far day one the injection was fine and just felt like a normal injection it wasn t painful but felt weird and unnatural obviously but fine straight after injection i felt a bit light headed but it went after around 10 minutes my throat felt slightly strange and slightly painful when i swallowed for the whole day but nothing terrible day two the throat pain has passed and i feel normal however my voice feels weak eating feels normal and i am having unusual gurgles in my throat after meals and feel very full even when eating small amount day three slow swallow has definitely started feels like you re about to choke after a bite of food until you have some water then it mostly goes it isn t actually too bad you just need to get used to it i m guessing it will get worse though as it s only day three having lots of small involuntary microburps day four a couple of microburps throughout the day slow swallow is a bit difficult but fine if i don t have dry foods and have water whilst eating in the evening i started drinking carbonated drinks to see if i could burp i ended up having around 10 proper burps day five slow swallow is still here but easily manageable i m now having proper burps without having to drink carbonated drinks to trigger them however they only come out if i turn my head to the side i think she was great but i would make sure to ask every question you can think of when seeing her for the first time and i think it s super helpful to call her office if you have any questions post-op i wish i had called her office more to ask what was normal to experience and how to address symptoms instead of trying to deal with it on my own first i m feeling great burping is definitely weird and i don t have control of it but the pain and bloating is gone and my experiences with acid reflux are also gone as long as i don t eat too many tomatoes i m not sure about her experience with heds but she was extremely knowledgeable about rcpd i m pretty sure she s been a doctor for at least a decade in the ent realm i think she moved over to working with patients with rcpd like 5 years ago or something she has a vast amount of knowledge though and was able to answer all of my questions and then some i wouldn t worry about her credibility in the slightest hi i m feeling much better i actually wrote a 2 month post op as well and answered some questions people had in the comments if you re interested best of luck https www reddit com r noburp s etvotvhh2h curing voice after botox i had my botox 10 days ago my voice is still very sore and
