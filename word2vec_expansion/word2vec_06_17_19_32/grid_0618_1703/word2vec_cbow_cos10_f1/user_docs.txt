Preop tests at BVI
What are the "pre-op" tests like for Dr. Bastian? I have an appointment in a couple months and I have a test one day and Botox the next. Is the test the tube down the nose so there will be lots of gagging?
Is anyone else interested in a survey of this subreddit?
I think it would be really interesting to do an overall survey of fellow no-burpers to see what kind of correlations there are amongst this group. How many exhibit certain symptoms? Are there dietary considerations? Does it relate to demographics?  I would be happy to set up this survey and analyze the data, if there is an interest in it.   **EDIT: There does seem to be interest in this - please suggest questions or symptoms to include in the survey!** Sorry for the spammy comments, I just wanted to be sure those who commented got a reply notification.
Survey Update: TL;DR Sorry, results coming very soon.
Sorry to all who've been waiting for the survey results. I took on a bunch of side projects at once and suddenly had no free time. I've also been working with a doctor who is interested in this data in getting it published in a journal!  I will get back to these results this weekend and will have them posted here no later than the end of the month. Promise.  Thanks for your patience!
2019 /r/NoBurp Official Survey
2019 /r/NoBurp Update
Hey all, thanks so much for all the input into the 2019 survey! There have been a whopping 565 replies so far and more are trickling in, so I am going to leave it up for at least another week or two. Once the responses seem to stop, I'll analyse the results.   For those who have not taken the survey yet, please do so [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebYi-dRBl00Jjyfw8cG6hqnb54sGceWAlDG79wgZTIPDUlcA/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Cheers  edit: oops meant to title it 2019 /r/noburp SURVEY update.
Anyone seen Dr. Bielamowicz?
Has anyone seen Dr.  Bielamowicz in DC for botox?  I went to Dr. Bastian for the first round because I didn't think there were doctors in my area, but then I heard I about Dr.  Bielamowicz.  I don't see any posts related to him, so I just wonder if anyone has had botox with him and the results and if you liked him?  I loved Dr. Bastian, but driving 700 miles again isn't appealing.
I hate it (also does anyone else here get killer hiccups?)
2019 /r/NoBurp Survey Results
## Introduction  I would like to start this post by reminding everyone that **I AM NOT A DOCTOR**. Information that you get online does **NOT** replace seeing a general practitioner, and that you should always take things your read online with caution. You are responsible for your own safety. If I told you that jumping off a cliff would help you burp, would you do it? I should hope not. That being said, I hope the advice I offer here is slightly more useful than that.   Thank everyone again for their patience while I took forever to get these results out. My life got unexpectedly crazy busy (maybe taking an unpaid internship on top of a full time job was not my smartest move), so it took me a lot longer to get through these results than I had originally intended. Also, some very interesting things happened that are relevant to this survey and /r/NoBurp, which I'll go into more detail about at the end of this post.   The data analysis done on the survey responses is basic. There was a total of 789 unique responses to the survey, which is far more than I had ever anticipated. I want to thank everyone who participated in this, we all own this survey and its success.   Here are the initial assumptions that I made when going through the survey responses:   * I eliminated any duplicate entries (4)  * Answers clearly avoiding the question were rendered null. Examples: Country: Not America. Weight: 0.0. Note that only that question was rendered null. The rest of the questionnaire was considered to have been answered in good faith  * Any combination of multiple races entered were interpreted as "mixed race"  The fuzziest demographic data was weight because it was not always clear which unit was used. This is my fault for not specifying in the question. The data was interpreted with the following assumptions:   * anything in the single digit or < 20 range is stone  * anything in the double digit range is kilo  * anything in the triple digit range is lbs  ## Demographics:   [Race](https://imgur.com/cjDA689)  [Weight](https://imgur.com/Q0tPrjU)  [Age](https://imgur.com/su5mv8x)  [Gender](https://imgur.com/sY7YVSB)  [Height](https://imgur.com/u5HxLKC)  [Location](https://imgur.com/AfyHYGX)  ## Symptoms:   Here is the [list of most common symptoms suffered by those who identify as "non-burpers"](https://imgur.com/apoQ1A1). Here are the [most common dietary triggers](https://imgur.com/1Kn60FW). And [37% of non-burpers who have been pregnant said that pregnancy did affect their BRD symptoms](https://imgur.com/7ojS29N), which makes sense.   ## Treatment  Unfortunately, very few people have had their concerns about BRD taken seriously by a general practitioner. [Here are the answers to the general questions about treatment (both self and professional](https://imgur.com/G8AVKFQ).   Teaching yourself to burp:  There was a variety of answers to how some people have taught themselves to burp. I’ve simplified the list of suggestions down to the following:   * Drinking soda. Force burbs  * Be relaxed (lying down, no constrictive clothing) and keep your esophagus straight and open  * Do “exercises” that will work your throat muscles. This might feel like “forcing” a croak up your throat, ensuring your throat is relaxed,   * Messing with your gag reflex (I’m not sure what this means, but several people mentioned it)  * Gagging or coughing  * Deep breaths (followed by working your abdominal/throat muscles, sort of like vomiting)  * Massaging throat or pressing down on throat when you feel the need to burp  * Some people suggested that "vomiting air" in the bathroom eventually lead to being able to burp  This is my favourite funny suggestion in two iterations (please don’t do this to yourself)  * I punched myself in the throat to release the tense muscle. Over time I no longer needed to hit my throat.  * One drunken night I tried a sort of karate chop on my throat that kind of worked  Other self-treatment suggestions to relieve gas mostly tend to refer to “air puking”. Here are a few other suggestions that were made:  * Doing some star jumps or a quick jog can sometimes dislodge some gas  * Lying down flat on back  * Hot showers   * Holding my breath to get rid of the hiccups  * In order to release all of the gas, I’ll do a handstand on the wall and be able to release most flatulence.  * Sucking in my stomach can cause a gurgle, which gradually relieves the pressure  * Mint tea   * Fennel seeds  * Eating probiotics  * Crystallized ginger  * Salty snacks like pretzels help reduce effects of bloating.  * Fish oil supplements  * GasX (most commonly reccommended drug), Simethicone, Tums/Antacids, Ranitidine, Dramammine  * Taking an activated charcoal to reduce gas   * Rubbing my stomach   * Avoiding aggressors like carbonated drinks  * Fasting  * No-carb diet  * Eating smaller and more frequent meals throughout the day.   * Eating slowly  * Hot compresses.   Again, here is a funny reply. “Making myself gay usually does the trick.“ I truly suspect they meant “gag” instead of “gay” but I still laughed at the idea that making yourself gay could help you start burping.   ## Botox Treatment There are few enough responses (10) to this that I am just going to [post the entire responses](https://imgur.com/SiPd3lA) for people to look through.  ## Comments  * If this survey is done again, have more detailed questions about farting  * Sticky post compiling burping exercises or methods for alleviating pain would be a good idea for the sub. BRD is just a pain.  * A flair for posts with exercises/treatments (as opposed to questions) would be helpful  * Have a pamphlet/info we can share with our doctor that explains the condition so that they can look into it more.   Some really great comments as responses to “And to end on a more positive question, are there any upsides to being a non-burper?”  * noburp my homies I love you   * really glad to have found my people   * I hope to meet one of you irl, we are such rare unicorns.  * "to find other people who suffer and take it seriously. Even my family didn’t take it seriously until pretty recently. I’ve started being really open and honest about it with people to lesson the embarrassment. "  * Kids think gurgles sound like a velociraptor   * being part of a small group of elite humans   * Dragon/Demon burps are almost a fun party trick! XD  * I have legendary farts.  * People think my little hiccups are cute, they call them "cheeps" and I've been told they're adorable.   * I don't have to taste burps (it seems like they usually taste bad).  * I have probably unintentionally broken some farting world records  * Not really. My girlfriend burps like a demon. I wish I could answer her burp calls.   ## Conclusion I love how y’all describe the weird sounds that your throats make. Demons screaming, velociraptors, cheeps. It's so good.   Some of the comments about how BRD affects your life are...hard to read frankly. People here talk about it ruining their lives, how they feel unrecognized and unhelped. I want to let everyone know that you are not alone!  First of all, if you are ever thinking about harming yourself, please don't do it! There are resources out there that can help you, and that is something you can never take back. Please go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicideprevention/comments/6hjba7/info_suicide_prevention_hotlines/) for more resources for help if you need it.   Secondly, I coming bearing good news! Not long after I posted the survey here, I was contacted by a real life medical doctor who has a patient that also cannot burp. He was searching the internet for literature on this condition and came across /r/NoBurp and this survey. He agrees that it seems like a largely unrecognized medical condition and asked if I would be willing to share the results with him for the purposes of co-writing a paper on the topic! I have been working with him ([Dr. John Rosen](https://twitter.com/johnmrosen)) and a health psychologist, Dr. Christina Low-Kapalu on the results analysis and are preparing a paper to be presented at a national meeting. I'm not sure when that will be published, but I will be sure to update this subreddit when it does!  AND there is more! A journalist from the Guardian reached out to me because she wants to write a feature about this condition and this survey. She also cannot burp, so she feels our pain. That should be coming out pretty soon.   If anyone wants a link too all the imgur images linked in this post [here](https://imgur.com/a/7QtLMm9) is the whole album. Let me know if you have any questions or comments about the analysis of this survey.  #EDIT:   I just realized that I forgot to include some of the information about other symptoms, including info about emetophobia, etc. I will update this post with that information as soon as possible.
2019 /r/noburp Survey Now Closed
**Final EDIT: Closed again**   *** **EDIT: Due to a bunch of requests from those who missed the window, the survey will be reopened for THIS WEEKEND ONLY. Link [here](https://goo.gl/forms/yOZooLntUo9BZ3qZ2). It will be closed for good Monday morning.**   ***   Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to the survey! I am no longer accepting new responses   The replies have been trailing off, so I decided to close the survey at a whopping **774 responses**. This got a lot more attention that I had expected, with previous subreddit surveys ([2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/4ao8us/i_visualized_uhdawgggy_and_ufooby420s_survey_data/) and [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/3b2pd6/preliminary_survey_results_feedback_appreciated/)) coming in with around 200 responses each. However, likely due to the influx from AskReddit about a month ago, it seems that it was the perfect time to do a new and improved version.   There's a lot of data, I just spent several hours doing a first pass through it. It's going to take a while to get it all interpreted in a meaningful way, so I may break it down into sections (probably those from the survey), and release it piece by piece. So hold on to your gurgles, everyone. It's coming soon.
New to No Burp? Here from Tik Tok? Designated Discussion Thread.
We've had a [real spike in traffic](https://imgur.com/Kn0WSvq) over the last couple of days, and it seems like a lot of people have been directed here from a Tik Tok video. So welcome! I wish you many future burps (though it seems unlikely at this point).   There have been a lot of new posts from the Tik Tok incomers, so it seemed prudent to direct them all to a designated discussion thread rather than clutter up the main feed. Got questions? Post them here! Also check out the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index).   Please remember that this subreddit is not a replacement for a doctor.

Burps are weird sounding
Anyone post botox and their burps are not really burp sounds?  I'm 6 weeks out now and my burps (according to my husband) are reminiscent of the sound of the zombies in the Walking Dead (I haven't watched the show, but I have heard the show while he's watched and think he's correct unfortunately).  Does the sound of the burp change to something more "normal" as time passes and botox wears off completely or is this what I am now because the current sound  is fine while I'm working from home during the pandemic, but it would definitely be embarassing if I were in the office or around others?
Weird sounds after botox?
This question is for those that have already had Botox (with any doctor).  I just got the Botox last week with Dr. Bastian and the day after I was having microburps.  Now, I am able to release trapped gas, but I would not call it a burp.  It is more a gurgle that comes out - like my UES is still tight, but air is kind of leaking out, slowly, but not in one "pop" like a burp.  Anyone else had this?  I am scared my UES is crazy tight and the botox loosened it up a bit, but it won't last.  Did anyone else have weird gas release that wasn't a burp and burping came later?  Also, feel very "phlegmy" like mucus constantly in the back of my throat.  Actually so much its kind of stuck and changing my voice.  I have a follow up with Dr. Bastian tomorrow, but just thought I'd see who else might have experienced this.  I am so glad to be be able to release gas no matter what weird sound it makes at the moment, as not feeling bloating 100% of the time is amazing.
George Washington University Study - Looking for Participants
Hello all,  I've been reached out to by a researcher from the George Washington University doing a study on R-CPD (/u/RCPDQuestionnaire). At their request and for the sake of visibility, I am reposting their survey and pinning it to the top of the sub.   Details:  >Thank you to everyone that helped in our research and feedback for the survey! While we cannot change the content of the questionnaire currently, we will incorporate additional feedback in future iterations of our study!  >We did adjust our demographics so that individuals outside of the US can participate and we would love to hear from you.  >The original post and description of the research study is reposted below:  >Currently, I am on a research team at our institution working in conjunction with the department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery at The George Washington University attempting to better understand retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction, or RCPD. This condition is also referred to as "no-burp syndrome."  >The objective of the study is to validate a patient questionnaire regarding symptoms of RCPD, in order to develop a diagnostic tool for this condition. Among those who have received treatment for RCPD, we also aim to assess effectiveness of treatment(s) for RCPD.  >Your insight is invaluable, and we would greatly appreciate your time (around 5 minutes) in filling out a short survey regarding your experiences with RCPD.  >Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous.

Neck exercises
Anyone ever achieved relief from the neck exercises on Bastian's laryngopedia where you hang your head off the side of a mattress and do some exercises?
Call for Mods and for Sub Feedback
Hello everyone! Wishing everyone no bloating and normal amounts of gas.   I am a little embarrassed to realize that I am the only remaining active mod on this subreddit. The other mods have not been active on reddit for a while, but this subreddit is more active than ever. As such, I’d like to put up a call for mods and for suggestions to improve the subreddit. This is the time to make this subreddit yours, and to discuss the direction you want it to take.   **Call for Mods**  I'd encourage anyone who's interested to [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7hGtywRLNRLx_Leb-5PrbAQdr1_2pdKDU3ltUf2Kizh5Whw/viewform?usp=sf_link), particularly if you're a long-time user of the sub or have experience modding other subs or on other websites. We plan to choose a handful of people-- the final number depends on the number of applications received-- and will reach out to people within a few weeks with our decision. If we don't get enough applicants, we'll keep the form open and this post pinned-- so if you're seeing it on the homepage, please consider the application as being open.  **Call for Suggestions**  I’ve also added a [section in the survey for suggestions for the subreddit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7hGtywRLNRLx_Leb-5PrbAQdr1_2pdKDU3ltUf2Kizh5Whw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note: it’s the same survey, but you won’t need to fill out the questions regarding the call for Mods.   To get ahead of the expected most common suggestion: a list of doctors who provide the Botox procedure. When I started as a mod, I updated the wiki and started creating a list of doctors. However, this subreddit has really gained some momentum since then and a) it’s a lot of effort to keep that list up to date and b) I suspect it’s going to become a novel within the wiki as more and more doctors start offering the treatment. Instead, I’d love to have this discussion here in this thread - what is the most effective way to help people search for a doctor specialized in this condition? An ongoing Google Forms sheet with the results linked so people can continue to submit responses without them requiring much curation? Quarterly pinned posts (linked to previous ones) where people can post where they have recently gotten the procedure, organized by geographical region?  I have pinned [u/karybrie’s excellent map of providers](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12z_14F_KSeeLAd_rTPnjJ_GvNtlVLaM&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C-114.22060924999994&z=1) to the subreddit wiki. So far this seems to be one of the most popular tools for tracking doctors, and I thank karybrie for their work in putting it together!   Open to any other discussion or thoughts here.

Some Canadian Doctors Have a No-Burp Group Chat!
I've been seeing Dr. Leclerc in Montreal and was talking with her today about scheduling my botox procedure. I mentioned Dr. Hicklin's paper about the awake version of the procedure and my doctor said she would check in with her colleagues about who does it awake/asleep. She said that she has a group chat with them to discuss this condition and its treatment!   I have no idea who is in this chat or not, but I thought you all might find that as delightful as I do. Nice to know that there is an ongoing dialogue about this treatment.   It sounds like Dr. Anderson in Toronto does it awake, but everyone who does the procedure in Montreal does it under anesthesia.
Hypermobile with R-CPD!
What are the "pre-op" tests like for Dr. Bastian?  I have an appointment in a couple months and I have a test one day and Botox the next.  Is the test the tube down the nose so there will be lots of gagging?
Having the AMA open a week ahead of time is a great idea so there will be questions prepped and people can upvote the best ones.
I always said I had a chronic case of "the hiccup". I'd only get one, but very frequently.
Hey u/LoveMyslf, your comment has been removed by reddit. I don't have any visibility on why (or what your original comment was).
Me too! I've always avoided tomatoes and in the last 5 years or so I've cut out every tomato-containing product.   My R-CPD symptoms got worse with age too, and they were compounded as I developed dietary intolerances. I did an elimination diet last year and have cut out certain FODMAP groups that upset my stomach. It hasn't solved the R-CPD, but it has lessened some of my symptoms.
Can't hurt to keep an eye out for dietary intolerances in general (FODMAP or otherwise). Again, it won't cure R-CPD, but it could help with symptom management if you do happen to have have dietary intolerances as well.
> Every side effect that I experienced was very minor, most were temporary  What side effects did you have? Which were temporary, which were not?
It's a very good idea. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to set something like this up. If someone sees this post and wants to help out, shoot the subreddit mods a message.   I'll send an internal message around the mod chat and see if anyone else knows how it works.
Thank you for this, as you mentioned, I haven't seen many experiences in DC and this is good information.  I just had my second round of botox with Dr. Bastian last week and if it wears off again and I lose the ability to burp, traveling to Chicago is getting cost prohibitive, so I was wondering if Dr. Bielamowicz is good.  Is he personable?  Did you like him?  What tests did he require before the botox?
Probably not what you want to hear, but yes, there is uncontrollable burping which happened for me pretty much the day after.  Laugh -> burp, cough -> burp, twist your torso -> burp.  Anything that might squish up your stomach seemed to push the air up and with a dead UES due to botox, the burps come right out.  I did have some while speaking and was glad to be working from home and not talking to anyone that much.  I'd reschedule one of them if you could as telling people the situation just gets weird.  Telling my bosses what my issues were to get the botox was weird, as it sounds trivial but people don't realize how awful it is and don't understand.
Yes, I'm in MD
Thanks. Hope you have success.
For me, it was full on, but everyone is different. Some people say they are only getting microburps the entire first week.
How is the in office procedure.  Dr. Spiegel said I could do it for my next round next month, but I'm a bit uncomfortable just thinking about a needle in my neck.
No actual vomiting, just when air comes up to burp, some stomach contents come up with it and you swallow it back down. Sounds gross, but really just happens involuntarily. You'll do great!
omg no
I've wondered this same thing, as if the muscle is already too tight, why strengthen it?
Good luck!
Yes, I still burp now. Granted, I got botox 3x for it to take, but I would have done it regularly if needed after feeling how the other half lives!
> The barium swallow cannot detect R-CPD anyway  Agreed. My ENT wanted me to do the barium swallow to rule out any other ENT issues, not to diagnose R-CPD. It was part of the process, but it wasn't a diagnostic step.
Done
There can only be two announcements posted to a subreddit at one time. I meant to replace the original Bastian publication post with this one, but I accidentally also deleted the other one.   A friendly reminder that a lot of the information from those posts is available on the [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index).
Do you know if BI has any kind of list of these recommendations?
I just did the same.  My hiatal hernia had gotten larger and both the GERD and R-CPD caused esophagel motility problems, so I got the hiatal hernia fixed about a month ago and will be going to Chicago in December for the botox.  I definitely feel different inside after the hernia repair in terms of gas moving around since it can't escape through burps - causing more discomfort.  Hoping after botox my insides can heal completely and get back to normal. Good luck with yours!
Are you lactose intolerant? Have you tried coffee with lactose free creamer or milk?   Straight coffee never gives me a problem, though I mostly drink tea.
That might explain my situation. I've had chronic heartburn since I was a kid (less then, more now).
So your heartburn has improved since the botox procedure?
Were you given a myotomy by mistake? What is meant by number 5?
I wanted to offer a different perspective as a 49 year old that had the botox at age 47.  Like everyone else, I didn't know other people had this until I found out about R-CPD in 2020.  I thought I was just defective and not much I could do about it.  I also went through a MAJOR flare up with my GERD in 2020 that caused me to finally schedule surgery for hiatal hernia.  As part of the whole trying to fix my digestive tract, I decided to do the botox too.  Just like you, I can't say I felt the effects of lifelong R-CPD.  I didn't have pain and I always had a little extra weight, so I didn't notice any horrible bloating.  After getting the botox, let me telll you this.  YOU EXPERIENCE THE SYMPTOMS - YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT because the bloating is your norm.  That is because you've lived with this all your life.  It is NORMAL for you and you've never been able to burp, so you don't know any different.  Once I could burp, I could then feel the difference.  I used to wonder why on days when I had to go into my office, my pants would always feel really tight on the way home.  I guess I was just basically clueless and unaware, but it was because I was wearing business casual pants with a button to work versus the sweats I wear at home and the pants got tight from bloating increasing throughout the day.  I never understood why my pants were tighter because not burping and bloating were my norm and I honestly didn't know any other way to live.  Once you experience the relief from burping after botox, you'll not be able to believe you lived the way you did for so long.  IT IS SO WORTH IT!    Not only the comfort aspect, but there are physical reasons for getting the botox.  Dr. Bastian told me the esophagus gets dilated from the air bouncing up and down in the esophagus all the time (the gurgles).  My esophagus doesn't work.  I had manometry for the hiatal hernia surgery and I failed miserably - my esophagus doesn't contract to push the food down.  Dr. Bastian says it is due to R-CPD because the esophagus was stretched for over 40 years and the muscles don't work anymore.  My LES is shot due to the pressure the gas in the stomach put on it for all those years so I am permanently on PPIs to try to avoid constant reflux that might lead to esophageal cancer.  Yes, long-term PPI use may contribute to dementia later in life, but I have to choose between esophageal cancer or PPIs.  If I could have burped all my life like a normal person, my esophagus would probably work and I wouldn't have even had GERD maybe.  I wonder what dysphagia issues I will have in my old age with an esophagus that doesn't work.  Therefore, if you have the opportunity to get the botox, do it.  It is about more than just discomfort - there are long-term complications that result from this condition.
> except for maybe the Botox prescription itself  That was free for me in QC last week!
Friday botox gang say what!   I was pretty sleepy the day of, and slept well that night. No other side effects from the GA. No aches or soreness.
It's likely acid reflux.
I get brutal hiccups, way more painful than most people seem to. I have to lie down ASAP, and it seems tied to drinking carbonated drinks. I think there's a correlation there.
My doctor (Canada) told me that she had heard of doctors in Italy doing the procedure at a dose of 10 units, which seems way too low.
You're welcome!
The other main risk is not specific to the Botox itself, but if you do the procedure under anaesthesia, there are inherent risks with going under.
Most likely not due to needing anesthesia. The botox can also make heartburn worse (temporarily) which is apparently not great if you are pregnant.
I would burp a couple of times a year before botox, but I really agree with /u/emcorn, they are much fuller and more satisfying afterward.
Yes, depends on the provider. The doctor I'm planning my procedure with isn't comfortable doing it without anesthetic because she isn't as familiar with that version of the procedure. So that's a conversation to have with specific doctors.
Yo, that is a weirdly helpful description!
Why do you say that you had the treatment "many times"? Most people only do it once or twice, from most posts in this sub
How many treatments did it take?
Check the mod list ;)
I can roll my r's very well
Speak for yourself. I have R-CPD diagnosed, I had the botox treatment and it has greatly improved my life.   I used to be able to burp (no control over it) a few times a year. They would just pop out. But 99% of the time, I experienced the bloating, discomfort, and inability to burp that everyone else here has. I never had emetophobia, but it was physically difficult for me to vomit.   Human bodies vary. People with the same condition fall within a bell curve. So please remember to be considerate, welcoming, and kind to people who come to this subreddit looking for help.

Welcome
The best way to approach doctor's appointments is to be well prepared with the information they will need.   1. I have symptoms [X, Y Z. . .] 2. I have had these symptoms for [period of time] 3. These symptoms have the following detrimental effects on my life [give specific examples] 4. Follow up with a call to action  [are there potential medications that can treat this?] [are there treatments for this] [Can I get referred to a specialist] [What are the risks/outcomes associated with different treatments] [I have heard of this specific treatment, can we discuss it] [what are the next steps to doing that?]  I find that I get flustered at doctors appointments and sometimes forget to include everything, or that I don't think I expressed myself well. So I write down the issues I want to address and what I want to get out of it, then I jot down a few quick notes during or after the appointment to remind myself of all of the outcomes. Know what points you want to press (in the case of R-CPD, likely "yes this is a real and significant issue in my life and I want to address it").
If that is something he tracks
Fabulous! Great doctor and still burping over one year later.
I love this subreddit.
I had botox one week ago and you are out pretty quick.  You are sitting there longer for pre-op than for the surgery and recovery.  Surgery was probably 15 minutes and I'd say I was in recovery maybe 30 minutes, then out and we drove home to Maryland.
I never felt like I had trouble swallowing.  Then I had to have manometry done for my hiatal hernia surgery and I failed 100% of the swallow tests and was surprised since I didn't think I had swallowing difficulty.  While waiting for my hernia surgery, I found this forum and scheduled an appt with Dr. Bastian.  He told me that after years of the gas trying to come out and because we can't burp, the esophagus dilates and that causes swallowing issues.  He also said that after botox and the ability to burp, the esophagus is believed to slowly heal and regain its movement and therefore the swallowing difficulties get better.  I guess maybe all of us non-burpers have some level of swallowing issues, only I didn't know it because I've never been able to burp, so I never knew any different since its been messed up since birth.
I just had an esophageal valuvulplasty and hiatal hernia repair about 12 weeks prior to botox.  I can't say there have been any complications as a result of that surgery before botox.  My symptoms post botox seem pretty typical to everyone else - release of trapped air now, some trouble swallowing and some regurgitation and phlegm.
I just had botox last week, under anesthesia.  Is the no anesthesia procedure the needles of botox through the neck rather than through the mouth?  If so, Dr. Bastian did say that through the neck was more unpleasant.
One week, just had it the 16th
Please don't continue to repost the same things in order to be at the top of the subreddit. I am going to remove this post, feel free to edit your original to include the same content it did originally.
My acid is horrendous. I haven't been diagnosed with GERD yet, but I am looking into it with my doctor. Apparently, the waitlist for an endoscopy here is a year so maybe I'll know more in October?
I had botox one week ago and I am exactly #2 and #4.  I will just keep doing fizzy drinks and keep trying.
Welcome! We have gas.
I can count on one hand the times I've burped in my life.  Each time was a "microburp" that was a complete accident and took me by surprise because it never happens.  I just gurgle all day long and I'm not overly flatluent either.  I can't even imagine what its like to live life not bloated all the time.
Yeah small world! Amazing.

Sometimes my partner will do that or a backrub for me. It doesn't get a proper burp out, but it gets the gurgles going intensely, so it provides some relief.
Sometimes I find the gurgles come all the way out. Like pseudo-burps.
OHIP is the Ontario equivalent to RAMQ
I had the mucus feeling for several week afterwards.  It did go away.  However, my ability to burp is going away and I think I may have to go for a round 2.  Practice as much as you can around the 6 week mark because everything before that are burps because its all open from the botox, but when it starts wearing off, you have to try to learn how to do it.
Unfortunately, I don't think you have any way to tell.  I am almost 4 weeks post Botox and I still do not have control over it.  Sometimes I cough and burp, or laugh and burp or talk and burp.  Anything that might squinch up my stomach causes me to burp, so I'm glad I'm working from home and don't have to be on the phone much.  It is not all the time and maybe you can plan meals around meetings, like don't eat right before hand?  Of course if you have leave built up from not vacationing during the pandemic like a lot of us do, maybe you want to just take off a couple weeks and relax.
If you wanted to collaborate, we could rework the 2019 survey and reissue it. Shoot me a PM?
I took that for a while for acid reflux. Didn't help with burping.
Nothing preventing travel in terms of physically getting up and going, as you shouldn't have any issues walking around or tiredness wouldn't really be an issue.  The issue is, is this a vacation and the difficulty swallowing would affect your enjoyment of your vacation?  I had trouble swallowing for like a week at least afterwards and a "mucusy" feeling in my throat for maybe 3 weeks or so which was annoying, but not unbearable.  So, it depends on whether you want to deal with those while on holiday.  Remember too, the burping can be uncontrollable.  The UES is just open after botox, so if I twisted in my seat - burp, if I laughed - burp, cough, burp, you get it.  Totally uncontrollable for like a month.  That being said, the bloating that comes with R-CPD is real too, so you trade off the post botox symptoms (if you wait) for the bloating you still have with R-CPD.  Your choice.  Having gotten botox 10 weeks ago and am now going back for a second round, I honestly have no idea how I lived with the discomfort of R-CPD for 46 years.  Going back to the gurgles is so unpleasant, I have no problem dealing with the trouble swallowing and mucusy feeling again.
I had to kind of "push" my stomach to get burps out at first.  I would kind of suck in the top in the abs to attempt to push air out.  I heard someone else physically pushed on their stomach to force it out.  Do whatever you can to practice, practice, practice.
I did and he was great. Great doctor. He did round 3 of botox for me last July and I'm still burping. Highly recommend him. Botox was actually cheaper with him than Dr. Bastian.
I'm in MD too and had the botox in December. I'm actually headed back to Chicago this week for round 2.
I have no idea how many units of Botox I got the first time.  It never occurred to me to ask.  Now of course, I'll be asking when I am there this week.  It started to wear off around week 8 for me and burping was getting harder.  I had to contort my neck and jaw into all kinds of positions. I was pushing my stomach and diaphragm so much I was sore trying to get burps out.  I faced the facts and realized I was one of the 1 out of 5 where it doesn't take and scheduled again.  Hoping I'm twice and done this time around and don't have to go the myotomy route.  I am 46 and talk on here says the older you are, the less it might take, so maybe that is it.  However, since Dr. Bastian only named R-CPD in 2019, no one ever knew about it before or what to do about it, so there was no option to try this earlier.  Practice trying to isolate the muscle needed to burp and do the fizzy drinks.  Practice, practice, practice.  I practiced too, but I'm going to do more this round.  Good luck with your healing and practice!
Dr. Bielamowicz is really nice.  I had my consult with him and have my botox tomorrow at GW Hospital.
Thanks! Don't remember how long for the initial appt, but it was about a month after the first appt before I could get in for botox.
Not necessarily. I have all of the classic symptoms of this group, but I burped normally as a baby. I still burp once or twice a year; I have been trying to train myself to do it more frequently with some progress. But most of the time I cannot burp and experience all the discomfort that other no-burpers do. Not burping seems to be a symptom, and it's very possible that more than one condition can cause it. It's not a well-recognized condition (or symptom). Let's be welcoming to all who struggle with non-burping.
I don't love you calling someone out as being "in the wrong group". If you struggle to burp, you are welcome here, regardless of if it's caused by R-CPD or GERD or of unknown cause.
I've found my no burp symptoms have stayed fairly consistent throughout my life, so far (31). Dietary changes did help me to a degree - I now drink very little carbonated drinks (used to drink a lot of beer) and it turned out I was having digestive issues as well. I've always had some food issues (growing lactose intolerance throughout my 20s), but they suddenly got way worse when I turned 30. Doing a elimination diet helped me identify things that were causing excessive bloating (turned out FODMAPs were part of it, but not the whole issue). So making those dietary adjustments reduced the overall amount of bloating and gas I had, even though they didn't fix the no-burp. They can't fix that side of things.   But I would highly recommend an elimination diet if you think you might be having digestive issues. Worst case, it's not from food and you're no worse off than you are now (and you have more evidence for your doc that R-CPD is the source of the issue). Best case, you identify some things that can help reduce bloating in your GI without needing surgery.
This is something I wonder about as well.   Though gurgling also makes my singing voice really weird.
My mom says that she doesn't really burp either, but I don't know if she means that literally or just that she doesn't burp a lot.
Identical or fraternal?
Wait, did the botox cause a hole in your esophagus? Please elaborate.
So the hole was caused by the procedure?   Are there any temporary or permanent side effects to that? Is it dangerous?
Where did you get the treatment? Which doctor?
YES. Oh my god this subreddit makes me feel so heard.
I brought it up to my doctor a few weeks ago and he told me that it's not a real medical thing, just a weird personal quirk. I am so glad I found this subreddit, it's amazing to see that it's not just me.
I've found that I gurgle a lot more when I take PPIs.
Anyone else have horrible heartburn? Mine is awful, and I was wondering if it was related to noburp.

Hi! I just found this thread for the first time. Sticky posts are not always the best bet because only two can be stickied at any one time, and eventually they can no longer be edited.   I'm incorporating the information for this post into the subreddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index) where I've been building a list of doctors who perform the procedure. Would you mind if I copy the **No doctors near you?** section into the wiki more or less verbatim? It's helpful and well-written and I think it would be a worthy inclusion.
Shoutout to the subreddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index) which is regularly being updated with more information and should be able to answer some of your questions.
Added to the wiki!
Excellent. Please suggest any questions/symptoms/thoughts for the survey! I've already started putting it together.

Thanks for the tip. I found a few old surveys that I will use as a starter point.
Thanks for the suggestions, included in the survey.
How much did it cost you? Are you a Canadian or American citizen? Did your insurance cover it?
It's not well-marked. I've reached out to the subreddit mod to ask them to add it to the sidebar.
Cheers! I've updated the wiki to include all of the information in this post.
What procedure did you have done for acid reflux? Mine is so bad.
1. I'm afraid it will make my acid reflux worse.  2. I'm afraid it will damage my singing voice, which is important to me.
26f. I could fill the sails of a ship.
If I've got a doozy coming, I go to the bathroom or an empty room and try to let it go there. Mine didn't use to be so loud, but I've been doing laser hair removal downstairs and I swear they've gotten louder since.
I am happy to make the data publicly available, but not with peoples real names or reddit usernames attached. Some of this information is very personal, and I know I wouldn't want it tied to my account.   The survey is coming together nicely, it'll be posted soon!
That would be a difficult one to prove, I'm afraid. Is it even possible to not burp a baby?
Actually, I was trying to find some recent, official Reddit demographics to compare it to and had a hard time finding any. I guess that might be somewhat secret marketing information? However, as a woman who's been on Reddit for a decade, I have noticed that there are a lot more women around than there used to be.
You know what, there totally was questions about that. I think I might have missed some when writing up the data. I'll check today and update.
Already done! As soon as it was published, I forwarded it to him. We've been working with the term BRD because it was what I used in the survey (before Dr. Bastian published his paper), but we're discussing whether we should standardize.
I burped normally as a baby.
Agreed. I tried to find some official Reddit demographic data to compare to, but could seem to find anything. Still, it's a useful thing to put in a survey.
What's EOE?
Alright everyone, here it is. Thank you so much for your comments in my first post, they really helped this come together. I'll leave this up for a few weeks before analysing the data so that there will be as many responses as possible.   Cheers.
Either, as long as you specify the unit! I realize that it was locked as a number entry, so I changed that to any text entry.
It's going really well so far, there are already over 60 responses.
127 and counting! From one morning!
Cheers fam
Please take the survey! If you would like to answer the questions as you were before you could burp, that is great. There is detail later about teaching yourself to burp and the botox treatment, I would really love to get input on those sections as well.
In the short term, I am going to do a review of the data for the subreddit because I think a lot of people here will find it interesting. I am also going to use it to improve this subreddit's [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index), something I've already started working on. The goal of that is to provide more detailed information to subreddit newcomers or those seeking more information about noburp.
Absolutely, shoot me a PM!
THAT should have been a survey question! "  >What drinks do not upset your gut"
It was suggested by someone in my previous post where I asked for input on the survey.
We've got over **500 responses** so far everyone! Keep them coming.
She has kind of horrible [reviews](https://www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratings/90689/Dr-Jennifer-Anderson-Toronto-ON.html) online. Does this match your experience with her?
Good catch.  And wow, the account has been deleted.
FYI there is a list of practitioners in the sub wiki! It's a work in progress but it includes links and contact info for some doctors who have been recommended in this sub.
The link provided by /u/SilverBird4 covers the bases well, but I'd like to take this chance to pimp the /r/noburp **[WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/wiki/index)** which is currently being expanded to cover any basic questions newcomers to this sub may have. If you have any suggestions to improve this wiki (it is still in progress), let me know!
Hey , if you do happen to find someone in QC give me a shout. I live in Ontario and Quebec is close enough that I'd drive there to see a specialist. Check out this subs wiki for a list of known specialists, but it's pretty short at this stage.   And welcome to the club! The gurgly, croaky club.
Just saying, but Nutella is one of the most calorie-dense foods out there...
Yeah, I was half kidding. I only eat Nutella when doing long distance backpacking because the calorie-to-weight ratio is important there. Also because if I keep Nutella in my home, I will eat it out of the jar with a spoon.
Posted an update a couple of days ago, results are still trickling in so I'm going to leave it up for a while longer. Once responses to the survey taper off, I'll analyze and post the results.
We're here for you!
RemindMe! Two weeks
