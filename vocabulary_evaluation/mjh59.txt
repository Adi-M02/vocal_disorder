Title    : my symptoms, are they dangerous?
Selftext :
so I'm 17 and I havent been able to burp my whole life (except as a baby) sometimes I'll burp like once a year but i dont mean to, I dont usually have bloating but sometimes when I do gurgle I will get chest pain what lasts a few seconds then goes away n then I feel fine, does anyone else get this? I dont think its acid reflux as when I never gurgle I never get these chest pains, these chest pains dont happen every time I gurgle but do happen sometimes when I do gurgle, it is annoying as it is uncomfortable, but I would love to know if this is dangerous or just something what is very annoying? and another question how do you lot deal with the gurgles if you are at college or work cos I usually relief mine at home when I lie down but I dont know what to do when I'm at college

thing is before I went to the doctors I was really worrying about it but then after I went to the doctors I've felt better and feel like the chest pains havent been as bad as they have been so maybe I could've had minor health anxiety and me thinking about it may of made it worse than usual

if you're out try chewing some gum that usually has some temporary relief of the gurgles n just eating slower and taking smaller sips can help, must've been annoying to have it all your life

acid reflux can be a symptom of not being able to burp, there are some exercises you can do which are meant to relax your UES and some people have been able to burp from doing it:

cricoid massage
shaker exercise

also some people air vomit or kinda of like beat the throat to try and force air out but I dont do this. 

everyone has their own symptoms for this, we've just got to live on I'm afraid unless you get treatment. try the shaker exercise and see how it goes and keep trying it cos you never know it could work :)

Title    : I'm curious for the future of us no burpers (medically wise)
Selftext :
I'm curious to know if in the future this will be a recognised thing and that it's something that every doctor will know how to do, will there be different procedures? will it cost anything? will most doctors be able to do it? I'm so curious surely medically wise this is going to get better in the future right?

Title    : I can burp now kinda (no botox)
Selftext :
so it all started a couple weeks back when I started trying the shaker exercise, I did this every day for 3 weeks or so and didnt get much luck probably a micro burp every 2 or 3 days, so I decided to stop as I didnt think it was working, but then 3 days ago I thought let's try it again, so I started doing the shaker exercise again and along with the 30 neck crunches exercise and now I'm micro burping so much its unbelievable, I feel like each day they're getting more forceful so I'm gonna carry on doing these exercises and hopefully I can strengthen them, so far I've dont 30+ microburps today with 2 being quite loud, has anyone got any tips on how I could strengthen them n make them more louder and more powerful

Title    : serious question about once you've learned to burp
Selftext :
if you taught yourself how to burp by doing the shaker exercise and other exercises, what are the chances of losing the ability to burp once you gained that ability by exercises?

you know the shaker exercise how you lift your neck so your chin touches your chest, instead of holding it just keep lifting your neck up and down so your chest touches your chest and repeat it 20-30 times
