Title    : questions about air vomiting / chest pains after drinking alcohol?
Selftext :
So all my life I've struggled with not being able to burp (just get gurgling noises that provide no relief, also very scared of vomitting and last time was about 10 years ago..)

When I drink alcohol I normally have lemonade as mixer or something carbonated, I find that after drinking a few I get really intense chest pains and I feel so 'full' that I can't bear to drink anymore (normally before I'm even drunk! So drinking out is a pain..)

Just now I had been out and had like a drink per hour..and twice I had suddenly felt very hot, mouth started salivating and then had to 'air vomit' but I don't even know if this is what's happening. I just like, gag and nothing comes out (but it doesn't seem like air is coming out either? Can you feel it??) But I immediately feel better after doing it. 

It's so weird and embarrassing, I had to leave suddenly to the bathroom as within a minute I suddenly felt this way and did this motion about 3 times then felt completely fine.

Is this air vomitting? Or what is it? Am I just sick from alcohol...but idk because when I drink at home I use a lot less lemonade and stir it a lot so there's not much carbonation, and I can actually get drunk before feeling the chest pain/sickness!

I still have chest pains after the 'air vomits', it doesnt go away, just takes time to wear off. Is this pain related to RCPD or something else??


Thanks all for any help :)

Hmm interesting, yeah it doesn't really sound like much idk. I guess I kind of try hold back because I'm afraid of being actually sick. Normally it's like a  gag / cough / choke kind of...I don't really know how to explain it?  There's a little noise but not *super loud*

So maybe this isn't air vomitting or perhaps just partially..? Maybe I can't make the proper motion of vomiting..when I get sick it's awful because I can't vomit, I just heave and heave cos I literally don't know how to force it out!

Title    : Worried my Botox hasn't worked (Day 3)
Selftext :
Hi everyone.

I had Botox a couple days ago with Lucy Hicklin in the UK.

After the procedure , I had a bit of tenderness and soreness but overall felt fine. I was gurgling quite a lot right after and was hoping one of them would magically turn into a burp, but no, nothing (cus how amazing would that be if not even an HR later I had already burped!)...I can eat just fine too, no slow swallowing, etc...

So it's now morning day 3 and I'm soo paranoid that it's not worked because I'm not feeling any side effects.  

Even if I don't have any side effects, could it still be working?

I don't really understand it, cos I had been reading up others experienced and some burped few days after, some a week, some more. Does the Botox need time to 'kick in' or something? If I had a really tight throat, would a higher dosage of botox be needed and so this dosage might not do anything? ðŸ¥²

I'd been hoping so much that this would help some of my issues as it's getting really bad lately and I will be so upset if I have done it all for nothing. :( 

How long would I have to wait til I can get more injected? 

Any advise or reassurance is welcome please...thank you all!

Do you have to wait a couple months after the initial Botox to have a new injection?

Title    : 2 weeks post Botox with Lucy Hicklin (1st dose)
Selftext :
Hi, I wrote a small diary for my side effects after Botox with Lucy Hicklin at the centre in Chelsea if anyone is interested. I posted a few weeks ago worried it wasn't working at all but I did manage to get some micro burps and large burps since.

I feel like by the end of the 1st week it seemed to be at the peak and I had a few large burps but mostly I only had micro burps. I also can only burp when I move my head to the right and lean downwards as if I was sniffing my armpit...which is a little bit awkward in public and at work so I'm too afraid to do it. :(  Moving my head about side to side I can find the 'sweet spot' sometimes and continuously moving my head into that spot makes the air come out, it's a bit strange!

 I haven't really managed to burp any other way, I have coughed/yawned a couple times and a burp kind of came with it but that's about it.

I'd say I've had less than 10 'large' burps where I truly felt my throat 'open' and pass the air, also tasted it lol.

Feeling a bit sad that it seems to be wearing off rather than improving, so I'm hoping that a 2nd higher dosage will give greater results as it's clear this injection worked slightly but maybe not quite enough!

14/08/2023
Day 1 - procedure was ok, very nervous for it. Injection was uncomfortable but not too painful. Tiny prick upon needle entering, then 'full' feeling as the Botox was injected. Throat felt 'full' like a lump stuck. Felt a bit light headed afterwards. Throat remained feeling full and like a lump is there, swallowing felt a little different and sore, turning my head/neck felt a little sensitive. When laying down and talking on the phone, my voice felt a little different, kind of 'wobbly'? 

Day 2 - feel completely fine, no different at all..eating fine

Day 3 - same as day 2, when I woke up, but throughout the day my swallowing seems a bit slower / like something stuck in my throat. Food seemed to get stuck in throat too but not near choking, just like something a little stuck where when you swallow so many times the feeling still stays. Also a little bruising, towards left of the centre of my neck

Day 4 - slow swallowing when eating, a few micro burps?! Feeling like there is a bit more trapped air that isn't turning to gurgles which provided a little relief, so it's a bit uncomfy..turned head to right side and lowered head a bit to chest/shoulders, managed to do 3 micro burps like this!! But there's not loads of relief

Day 5 - Still slow swallowing. I can do micro burps by lifting up my arm, opening my mouth and pushing my head towards my armpit like I'm sniffing it .. then little burps come out but they're so tiny and quiet. I videod this (discovered it accidentally after I sniffed my armpit and a burp came out lmao). Not sure if they're providing much relief, I do feel a bit less bloated but could just be placebo effect..

Day 6 - same as before, burping by turning my head and facing down. Did 2 quite big burps, I was sitting in the car and turning my head, these burps had a taste and felt quite forceful so I know they were proper! Felt like my throat was opening up

20/08/23 Day 7 - just micro burps using the head position, no big burps sadly. My stomach pains seem to not be as often / constant which is good.
Had a few large burps between these time. Most of the time still micro 

24/08/23 - feel like I was not burping so much today. I had a few small ones, and a big one, but alot of gurgles! Hope not going backwards!!

27/08/23 - not much burping, more gassy and stomach pains :(

31/08/23 - same as above, feel like not doing much burping, still gurgling, I can pass small amounts of air but larger gurgles get stuck and don't seem to pass. Sometimes I will gurgle/burp at the same time.

I can feel everything, I can feel when it's coming up, about to release, and sometimes it just gets stuck as it's about to and turns into a gurgle 


Hope this is helpful for anyone!

I just made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/166dyr0/2_weeks_post_botox_with_lucy_hicklin_1st_dose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1) about my experience after 2 weeks, by 7th day I had micro burps and experienced a couple large burps. 

Have you tried experimenting with head positions when you feel the urge to release the air, especially after eating/drinking. Try turning it, left, right, down/up..could maybe have some success there.

I had botox and the first couple weeks after I was able to micro burp but not fully burp. Sadly it's worn off now and am planning my 2nd dose, but while it was in effect I definitely felt my stomach issues were much better! I regularly have all the mentioned issues, stomach pain (usually after eating anything at all, doesn't matter what!), bloating, excess wind, going to the toilet 'too often'....etc.   


I'm hoping my 2nd dose will allow me to burp properly and hopefully these issues will go away too! :)

I noticed when doing exercises that compress my stomach area I get a lot of throat gurgles and it's really uncomfortable. Had to stop the other day as it just didn't feel good at all! Cardio seems to be fine for me, but I only normally do fast incline walking.

When I had my first Botox injection, the slow swallow didn't start until day 4 and lasted 1-2 weeks.

I had micro burps and only a handful of proper burps, unfortunately these stopped.

I will be going for 2nd injection in a few months too..

I get a lot of stomach pains especially in the morning like you say...rn I have called off work cus it's that bad. I have only had this level of pain 3-4 times in the past 2 yrs. Basically everyday  I have a constant pain but the pain level fluctuates. 

When I had my first Botox injection (worked for a short while but then stopped) I did feel as though my stomach and pain was much better.

The annoying thing is that the issues could be from RCPD, or it could be something else, but until my RCPD is fixed it will be hard to tell what's causing what..so I'm getting a second injection and hoping it will help.

If my problems persist, then it is most likely something else...IBS, food, whatever..and I will go to the doctor for tests.
My doctor's originally diagnosed me with IBS, but it's hard to handle cos it seems some days certain foods trigger my pain and other days they don't, so makes me think is it really that? Lots of RCPD sufferers get misdiagnosed with all sorts of stomach disorders.

Yeah, sadly I have a lot of trouble with swallowing pills do I couldn't take the medication prescribed when they suspected IBS. They just prescribed something to eat before meals that calms the stomach apparently. Even though the tablet is tiny I still can't ðŸ¥² it's a mental thing for sure...

Ah great, yeah please do let me know. Thanks. Hope you get some answers.

I have been to Lucy Hicklin in London twice. She mentioned Dr Karagama doing a different procedure where he is cutting the muscle? It sounds like it might be more successful as it seems like a more permanent and sure method. I hadn't heard of this before so I have no idea of the specifics though, this is just what she mentioned to me. Maybe you could inquire with him? He is based in London as well.

Title    : Does this sound normal for burping after botox treatment? 'Pop' feeling in my throat
Selftext :
Hi all, so I got my 2nd botox about 2 months ago now. I've had loads of relief and burp alot, however sometimes it seems really excessive.

When I burp, I feel the air coming up and I breathe in, feel a 'pop' in my throat, then I will immediately do a burp. This is usually how it happens, though sometimes the burps will just slip out and I don't breahhe in/do the 'pop'.

Is this 'pop' normal or is it me ingesting more air when breathing in and then immediately releasing it?

I do an excessive amount of burps and usually do massive burps about 50 times for an hour or longer after eating a meal. 

This morning I woke up and was immediately burping, without having even eaten anything? Why?!

It's great to be able to burp but now it feels like a whole other issue!

Has anyone else experienced this and does it wear off? 

Thank you

I still haven't figured it out, but think it's related to burping definitely....my Botox is wearing off a bit, sometimes I do the pop noise but can't burp after. But other times I do burp after..!!! Maybe I need to get another injection..

Yep, since I learned to burp from botox majority of the time I will feel a burp coming, breathe in with a pop, and then burp. It's weird but it does relieve it! But sometimes I will breathe in/pop to burp, but then the burp won't come out (I have experienced that more lately, which is why I thought my botox effects might be wearing off as I struggle to push the burp out a bit more often)

Title    : Lucy Hicklin pricing
Selftext :
Hi all,

Just hoping to get some comments from people about what they've been charged for by Lucy for the procedure.

I had my initial Botox done which was Â£850 for the consultation and the starting dosage of Botox (1 injection in one part of the throat).   

I then had a follow-up appointment (which was my latest appointment, back in November) as I had no relief from this, which I was advised would be Â£200 for the same dosage (1 injection) or Â£250 for increase dosage (2 injections either side of the throat).

I just tried to book in again as I am still burping but feel them getting trapped sometimes and am worried I will soon not be able to burp and wanted to book in for a few months incase I started worsening.

She told me it would be Â£575, Â£250 for the injection and the remaining is half of her consultation fee?

I was under the assumption any further doses would be Â£250 but now getting slapped with more than double the price I wondered if this is the norm?

Anyone else had this? 

Thanks!

Ah thanks, I couldn't remember discussing it all as it was a while ago and assumed any follow-up injections would just be the price of Botox only (Â£250).

But I guess she only offered this as a kindness to people who had no success with the injections :/

Ah true...thank you, I booked in just incase but probably cancel if I don't notice anymore of a decline in my burps.

I'm monitoring it a bit more closely as I noticed the pains coming back (they were basically all gone!) so just worried..

Yeah..when I first got my Botox I was burping like mad, almost too much it was annoying! Any little thing would make me burp alot and got hours. But that's obviously not normal..so maybe I am just expecting too much.

Thank you :)

Fair enough, I did ask for an explanation on the price and her secretary said it is  half the cost of consultation. But I can't see what there is to discuss, I had the injection, it's now worn off and can't burp again, so want to do the same again as a 'top-up' sorta thing.  Sadly have to pay extra Â£300 or so just because of that :(

Yes, I think that's what it is. I didn't realise the Â£250 was just a 'generosity' fee as it didn't work out so she just charge for the cost of the Botox / needle etc.

But as it's now worked, the generosity discount is gone so I got to pay for the other bits at half the price. 

Makes sense now!

A month or so. The first month I had the usual side effects and also burped far too frequently to the point it was just as annoying as not being able to burp! I'd just wake up and already be burping, then eating food and I would burp for hours after every minute or so. The good thing was that they never felt trapped, but it was just far too much! Those burps were also very loud and 'powerful'. That eventually subsided, and I'm now at 6 months post-botox and I'm still burping. I do feel like sometimes they get trapped and it worries me, but I think that is kind of normal. My burps are nowhere near as loud/big anymore, they are quite quiet and small. My stomach pains happen a bit more often compared to when I was burping so much, but it's still nowhere near what it was when I couldn't burp at all (everyday, after eating, at night when digesting food was when it was at it's worse). So I'd say 1-2 months before it feels 'normal'.

Title    : Lucky Hicklin 2nd dose botox success
Selftext :
Hi all,

Just wanted to update that I had my 2nd dose of botox back in November 2023 with Lucy. My first dose was unsuccesful, my 2nd one I had 2 injections either side of the muscle and this worked really well.

I'm still burping now, and majority of painful side effects all gone, get the ocassional trapped gas but I think that's just normal for everyone sometimes.

It's life changing. Best Â£1k I've ever spent.

Any questions I'm happy to answer :)

So first time, I never really had any burps. I mostly had microburps and that was it, didn't get much relief. Had to turn my head into my armpit to squeeze the burps out too, it was not good! I did have 1 or 2 big burps, but they were totally random and unexpected moments.

 Now I can feel it and push them out!

It's only because she is based in UK and we only have 2 options for treatment in the UK. The only other option is Dr karagama and he does surgery under anesthesia which is thousands of Â£Â£. Lucky hicklin does Botox injections for about Â£800 on first appointment, if doesn't succeed at all then she will do again for about Â£250 after. Anything else after that will be Â£575. 

So Lucy hicklin will be the obvious choice for most UK people :) I'm not sure about US doctors sorry.
