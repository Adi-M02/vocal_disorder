Title    : New here! Question about hiccups
Selftext :
Hi everyone! I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm a 28 year old woman and I‚Äôve never been able to burp. Every now and then I have what I like to call ‚Äúbaby burps‚Äù that really aren‚Äôt burps at all but just a little air that comes out. Still, the worst part for me is the hiccups.

I get horribly painful hiccups for prolonged periods of time. I‚Äôve recently learned of this subreddit and of R-CPD and was curious if anyone knows if bad hiccups are part of this condition or if it‚Äôs just me?

Title    : Has anyone used a doctor in NYC?
Selftext :
Looking into Botox but I live in NJ right near NYC so flying out to Dr. Bastian is an option, but not a preferable one. Wondering if anyone had any success with doctors in the NJ/NY/PA/CT area?

I‚Äôm so glad you shared this!! I live in NJ and have considered going into NYC to get the Botox done (I live right on the border of NJ and NYC so it‚Äôs very convenience). But I am worried about going to a doctor that isn‚Äôt Dr. Bastian since I‚Äôve heard so many great things. This really confirmed that he might be the right choice.

I am a 28 year old woman, and have never been able to burp, get painful hiccups frequently, and can‚Äôt drink anything carbonated. I didn‚Äôt even know there were others like me until two weeks ago when I found this subreddit and learned of Dr. Bastian. I‚Äôm glad you got your Botox young!!

I do have a question though: what was the surgery like? Did you have go to under anesthesia? I know you said your throat was sore for a few days but was there any other pain/side effects? Also, what was the process like with Dr. Bastian? Sorry, I know I ask a lot of questions lol üòÇ

Yes! Thank you! Out of curiosity, you said the Botox lasts 3 months. Is the idea that you get the Botox once or twice and then you retain the ability to burp forever, or do you need to keep getting Botox every X amount of time?

I‚Äôve thought about this surgery so much  and just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it. Maybe you can answer my questions?

1. How does the surgery work exactly? Do they cut you open? Are you put under anesthesia or are you awake? 
2. How long is the recovery time?
3. What was the process like? Particularly prior to surgery. How was Dr Bastian?
4. How is it now? Can you control when the burps come out? I know you said it was life changing but more specifically - like what are the feelings now? Do you get any of those same pains or gurgling noises sometimes?

Sorry, I know it‚Äôs a lot of questions but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm considering and don‚Äôt want to go into it blind. I‚Äôd want to see Dr Bastian but I know he‚Äôs in Chicago and I‚Äôm in NJ so I‚Äôd have to fly out to see him and want to make sure it‚Äôs worth it.

But you feel like the procedure really helped? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if it‚Äôs something I should do, but I like to know other people‚Äôs opinions and experiences. 

It‚Äôs funny though because right now I basically throw up when my ‚Äúnoburps‚Äù get bad so I‚Äôd basically be in the same situation lol. I basically just throw up bubbles. It‚Äôs the only way to relieve the sensation, but throwing up hurts a lot and I usually end up bursting a bunch of blood vessels in my face so it looks like I have a bunch of dark freckles. Ugh.

This is interesting. I have anxiety, some gut issues, and am overweight. I have lost about 40 pounds over the last several years but I‚Äôm still anywhere from 220-230 pounds depending on the day (goal is 200). I find that it was easy for me to lose the first 40lbs because it was all a diet change, but now that I‚Äôve been at a stable 230 for a while now (and eating healthy and exercising daily) I notice that I‚Äôm actually having more trouble losing weight. I also am having more rcpd symptoms than when I was at my heaviest. Bodies are so frickin‚Äô weird.

Title    : 2 days post-op (general anesthesia procedure)
Selftext :
Hi everyone! I just got the Botox injection with Dr. Hayley Born on Monday (it‚Äôs Wednesday now) and wanted to get some advice from those who have had this procedure before.

I noticed yesterday that I started having these weird gurgle-y, bubbly things come up in my throat after swallowing water or eating. It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs air in there and it wants to come up, but it‚Äôs so mixed with saliva that it‚Äôs all just a bubbly mess. 

The problem I‚Äôm having today is that it seems like it‚Äôs doing it now even just when I‚Äôm swallowing (no food or drink).  I actually had to throw up a little bit to feel like I got some of it out, and I haven‚Äôt been able to lay down because it feels like it just stays in my throat and doesn‚Äôt move down at all. 

Did any one else have an experience like this?

Title    : 2 Months Post-Op! (General Anesthesia)
Selftext :
Hey everyone! I got the Botox injection under general anesthesia 2 months ago now from Dr. Hayley Born in NYC and wanted to share some thoughts that would have helped me when I was considering the procedure. 

Please note that even my doctor told me that I was on a the higher side of adverse side effects from the procedure, so please take this with a grain of salt - but I'm someone who would have liked to have known all of the possibilities, so I'm sure some of you do too. 

1. General anesthesia 

* General anesthesia was a great idea for me specifically because I wouldn't be able to go to the doctor's office several times to get the in-office injections, whereas I could take a day off from work to have the outpatient procedure done, and not have to come back to the office.
* However, I did end up having a reaction to the anesthesia for a couple of days where my ENTIRE body felt like I just done the most intense workout of my life, especially in my calves, abdomen and arms. I seriously could not get out of bed without help because I couldn't use my abs to lift the top part of my body. It went away after a couple days, and apparently this is a common side effect of anesthesia, but it had never happened to me and I've had several surgeries, so thought it was worth noting.

2. Regurgitation and Slow Swallow

* Regurgitation: This is something I had seen on this subreddit but I didn't really pay any mind to at the time. This was a HUGE deal for me for about a month. The problem with this specific injection of Botox is that it basically paralyzes the muscle around the esophageal sphincter, which helps air escape the muscle and come back up in the form of a burp.... It also comes back in the form of whatever you've had to eat or drink. 
   * Phlegmy air bubbles (I called them the "gurglies"). The best way to describe this is having a lot of phlegm at the back of your throat but even after you clear it, it just keeps coming back. This was a scary one for me because I had never heard of anyone having these symptoms. It would get in the way of my breathing through my mouth, talking, and eating. 
* Slow Swallow: I know for a fact that some people did not experience this or did not experience it nearly as badly, but I know some people do have this issue so I just want to explain what it's like so they know what's "normal":
   * Coughing fits where something just seems to get caught in your throat and nothing will clear it until you regurgitate or vomit and get whatever is stuck, out. This was super uncomfortable, and made eating out at restaurants difficult. I did, in fact, have this problem at a restaurant and it didn't end well.
   * I can't emphasize this enough: DRINK WATER AFTER ALL OR ALMOST ALL BITES OF FOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER!! You're going to get to a point where you think "fuck it, I can eat five bites of pasta before I need a sip of water" but you DO need it, I promise it will help. 
      * In addition to that, LISTEN to what your body is telling you. If you've eaten and gotten to a point where you can start to feel the food you've eaten getting more and more stuck in your throat and needing more and more water to wash it down, STOP EATING. If it's so close to the surface and not going down smoothly, there's a good chance you might regurgitate it, and nothing feels worse than having to regurgitate food and wait until your next meal to eat. 

3. Acid Reflux

* Speaking of eating.... wowza. The Acid Reflux was a BIG problem for me. Here are the things I did to help:
   * Eat less tomatoes/tomato sauces
   * Eat more things high in fiber (chickpeas, potatoes, broccoli, whole grain bread, smoothies, etc)
   * Elevate while sleeping!
   * NO CARBONATED BEVERAGES - I know this feels like it defeats the purpose of getting the botox injection, but the carbonation will not sit well in your stomach. Give your body some time to reach the plateau of the Botox injection (about a month to a month and a half) and then you can go back carbonated beverages. Trust me, you'll still burp in the meantime.
   * No Alcohol. (If you're going to drink anyway, do it in very small quantities and very infrequently)
   * Ask your doctor if you should be taking anything like Gaviscon or even Famotidine (forgive me if I'm spelling that wrong) to help with your reflux. FAM really helped me a lot, but it takes a few days to start to work. 

4. Sleep

* Again, this is one of those things that not everyone experienced but it was a big deal for me - sleeping. 
* Because my regurgitation and acid reflux was so bad, I was forced to sleep pretty much totally upright for almost 2 months. At the month/month and a half mark I noticed I would scootch down more and more every night to get comfortable and now I'm only slightly elevated while sleeping. I'm glad I listened to my body and started reclining more when my body said it was okay with it. 

5. General tips:

* Bring water with you everywhere
* Eat slowly and deliberately. 
* Chew your food until it's paste
* Work at your body's pace. Let your body tell you what it needs and can't have. 
   * This is actually very important. I thought that since I was having issues with slow swallow I should only eat soft foods, but it turned out that soft foods just made it worse for me - it didn't slide down my throat like I would have liked. So actually, things that soaked up moisture worked better and then I could take a swig of water and it would go right down. (Breads, pastas, tortilla chips were my lifesavers)
* Don't freak out if your journey is different than someone else's. Our bodies are all different and we experience side effects, healing, and medications all very differently. Talk to your doctor, don't worry about feeling like you're asking too many questions - they are there to answer them and to help you get whatever help you need. There's no such thing as stupid question. 

6. BURPING!!!

* Here's the good stuff! Burping is wild. It feels good, but gross, and it's both happens on it's own and sometimes you have to force it. The best way I can describe what a burp feels like is that it's like a airy vibration in your throat.
   * Some things to note: you CAN force a burp! It doesn't just sit there causing you pain! You sort of have to push your tongue down to the bottom of your mouth, extend your neck a little bit, and exert a little pressure from your throat muscles. I also read from someone else on the subreddit that you can look to your left and look up and sometimes that helps too. 

Overall, I'm SO glad I got this procedure done. It sounds scary and there are a lot of moving parts to recovery (at least there were for me) but the fact that I can burp, I'm not bloated all the time, I'm not in pain, my hiccups aren't nearly as frequent nor are they painful, and I can eat/drink whatever I want without feeling like I'll pay for it later -- it's such a freeing feeling!

I hope this helps someone! It would have been great for me to know I wasn't alone in all of this at the beginning, and that a lot of the things I was feeling were normal, even if they were on the more extreme side of normal.

I wish everyone good luck on their journey. 

May we all be burping the alphabet any day now!

Great questions! I‚Äôm not actually sure the amount of Botox I got, but certainly more than you would get in the in-office procedure. They can‚Äôt give you that much in-office because they‚Äôre going in kind of blind (that‚Äôs why they only do one side of your throat at a time - usually about 2-4 office visits are required), but when they do general anesthesia they can see where they‚Äôre poking so they can inject a much higher dose. 

As for regurgitation:
the best way I can explain it is that unlike vomiting, where it comes after nausea and is usually somewhat painful because your body is trying to push it out of your stomach; regurgitation is more like there‚Äôs nothing is blocking the stomach contents from coming up, so it just sort of slides out. 
The regurgitation itself can be different depending on what you‚Äôre eating, how long it‚Äôs been since you ate, what positions you‚Äôre in.

If you didn‚Äôt eat for a while but you had a sip of water, only the water might come up and you can either spit it out or swallow it. But if you have a coughing fit after you‚Äôve eaten, you might kind of projectile whatever you‚Äôve just eaten. I handled it by eating smaller portions, eating slower, and drinking water in between sips so nothing irritated my throat to make me cough. 

But it could also just happen because of how you‚Äôre positioned. For example, bending down was not really an option for me unless I did it the way pregnant women do (bend down with your knees, lean back, and grab with your hand without bending over) because stuff would just come up.

But on the whole, I wouldn‚Äôt let the regurgitation hold you back from doing it. It‚Äôs unpleasant, for sure. But the freedom and weight that is lifted by having done this procedure FARRRR outweighs the negatives. You just have to be cognizant of your limitations for a few weeks. A lot of people don‚Äôt even get regurgitation and MUCH LESS people get it as bad as I had it. I was definitely in the extreme camp. Hope that answers your questions!

Well the good news is it‚Äôll be contained, lol! I would just bring a bowl with you while you scoop in case you need to cough anything up. You can even sit down on the floor and clean that way. Keep in mind, if you clean the litter boxes around when you first wake up before you eat, or several hours after you eat, you‚Äôll probably be able to bend like normal with nothing coming up. It‚Äôs only a problem when you have undigested food in your stomach.

Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Mine stopped around week 4, and since then it‚Äôs just been little things here and there if I over-eat or try to bend too soon after eating. I still get the gurglies sometimes but much much much less. My doctor explained to me that the height of the Botox injection‚Äôs effectiveness is basically between the first and the third week. So once you hit that three to four week mark, things start to get better.

It‚Äôs a slow process, and kind of a sucky one, but I promise you it‚Äôll get better and you‚Äôll be happy you did the procedure even with the issues.

I will say that I don‚Äôt really feel like my doctor walked me through all of the negative side effects as well as I think she should have. All of my questions were answered honestly, but I obviously would not have known to ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the regurgitation process like? how long does it last? and what can I do about it?‚Äù. I feel she should have those answers already and provided it without me asking since it seems to be a big part of the healing process.

I hope you feel better soon! If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out here or in DMs!

I wouldn‚Äôt be worried at all. I didn‚Äôt have any microburps until about a week in. I saw when I was looking for the same thing that some people didn‚Äôt get microburps for like 2 or 3 weeks, but the injection eventually did its job. 

I‚Äôd try forcing them a little when you think they‚Äôre close to the surface. I don‚Äôt know if it helps at all or if it‚Äôs psychological but I‚Äôve been able to force all of my burps out in due time (even it takes like 10-15 minutes), and I think it has to do with me associating the feeling of forcing it out with it happening. I‚Äôm not a doctor though, so that might be bullshit lol. Did you get in-office injections or general anesthesia?

That‚Äôs exactly what I did!

Thats why I wanted to write this, so maybe it helps someone in that situation understand the more realistic aspects of it, but also to understand that it definitely does get better, which is hard to hear when you‚Äôre in it and it sucks haha.

I think she was great, but I would make sure to ask every question you can think of when seeing her for the first time, and I think it‚Äôs super helpful to call her office if you have any questions post-op.

I‚Äôm feeling great! Burping is definitely weird and I don‚Äôt have control of it, but the pain and bloating is gone, and my experiences with acid reflux are also gone (as long as I don‚Äôt eat too many tomatoes). I‚Äôm not sure about her experience with hEDS, but she was extremely knowledgeable about RCPD.

I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs been a doctor for at least a decade in the ENT realm. I think she moved over to working with patients with RCPD like 5 years ago or something. She has a vast amount of knowledge, though, and was able to answer all of my questions and then some. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about her credibility in the slightest :)
