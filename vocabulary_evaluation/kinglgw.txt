Title    : Tips for getting surgery
Selftext :
I have only just realised that this problem Iâ€™ve suffered with for years is no burp syndrome and I need to get throat Botox to fix it! Iâ€™m so glad I finally have figured out what it is, but i donâ€™t know what steps to take from here. I went to my local GP and they just told me to keep a good diary and stay away from stuff that causes it (which is everything) so that wasnâ€™t helpful. Where do I go from here?

Is your throat still feeling uncomfortable? I think Iâ€™m going to be visiting her soon to get the procedure. How long is it difficult to eat for? Also did it effect your voice? Sorry for all the questions!

Title    : Question about treatment
Selftext :
I am 18 y/o and Iâ€™m doing my a-level exams in May and June. Iâ€™ve recently discovered Dr Hinklins treatment service and really want to get it but I am slightly worried that the side effects may cause issues with my studies. I just wanted to ask for some opinions of people who have actually got the treatment. Do you think that the side effects would cause issues with my studies? Would it be better to wait until theyâ€™re done?

Thank you!

Title    : How long until I can sing?
Selftext :
Hi guys. Iâ€™m getting my Botox by Lucy Hicklin on the 19th August. My band have been offered a good gig on the 29th August but Iâ€™m the singer and donâ€™t know how the Botox treatment affects the voice. What do you guys think?

I will be awake for my procedure. Do you think there is a risk of vocal issues?

I know it changes from person to person, but do you think I would be okay doing a gig on the 5th September if I get 50 units of Botox on the 19th August.

Thank you for your response. Iâ€™ve decided to take a bit of a risk and weâ€™ve booked a few gigs 3-4 weeks after the procedure. Worst comes to worst Iâ€™ll just cancel I suppose!

Are your burps now controlled or are they still out of nowhere? Iâ€™m a bit concerned about the social aspect of randomly burping ðŸ¤£

Title    : Post-Botox diary - success 
Selftext :
I had 50 units from Dr Hicklin on Monday. Here is my diary so far.

Day one:
The injection was fine and just felt like a normal injection, it wasnâ€™t painful but felt weird and unnatural obviously, but fine.

Straight after injection I felt a bit light headed but it went after around 10 minutes. 

My throat felt slightly strange and slightly painful when I swallowed for the whole day but nothing terrible.

Day two:

The throat pain has passed and I feel normal however my voice feels weak.

Eating feels normal and I am having unusual gurgles in my throat after meals and feel very full even when eating small amount.

Day three:

Slow swallow has definitely started. Feels like youâ€™re about to choke after a bite of food until you have some water then it mostly goes. It isnâ€™t actually too bad you just need to get used to it. Iâ€™m guessing it will get worse though as itâ€™s only day three.

Having lots of small involuntary microburps

Day four:
 
A couple of microburps throughout the day. Slow swallow is a bit difficult but fine if I donâ€™t have dry foods and have water whilst eating.

In the evening I started drinking carbonated drinks to see if I could burp. I ended up having around 10 proper burps.

Day five:

Slow swallow is still here but easily manageable. Iâ€™m now having proper burps without having to drink carbonated drinks to trigger them. However they only come out if I turn my head to the side.

Title    : Curing voice after Botox.
Selftext :
I had my Botox 10 days ago. My voice is still very sore and weak. Iâ€™m a singer and have a gig in 7 days. Currently I canâ€™t sing any of the songs I used to be able to. Is there any way to fix this or is it simply just a waiting game? Thanks.
