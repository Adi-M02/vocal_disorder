Gosh I literally had to double check I didn‚Äôt write this post because it is the exact same stuff I have gone through as well and I only found this group yesterday! I‚Äôm going to book an appointment with my GP on Monday but I‚Äôm not too hopeful as from this subreddit we clearly aren‚Äôt known about too much. 

I‚Äôve spent all day compiling sources and papers and articles and everything I can find to prove to my GP that this needs to be taken seriously. And since my gurgling has been unbearable today I‚Äôve recorded all the sounds to show them

I‚Äôve also had this for as long as I can remember but I‚Äôm now having to force myself to vomit multiple times a day and it‚Äôs just wrecking my quality of life. 

Hope you get the answers you need and PLEASE keep posting because as a very very poor student in the same boat I‚Äôll need all the advice I can get

Title    : AMAZING news!!!
Selftext :
Ahhhh, I‚Äôve struggled with RCPD for as long as I can remember but it has recently become unbearable. The other night I couldn‚Äôt cope anymore, I was making myself sick up to ten times a day just to release some air, it was awful, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and email around every local private ENT with special interest in laryngology and this morning I heard back from one saying he would love to help me out!!! He can see me THIS week as a private patient or in a few months as an NHS patient!!! And his fees are SO much less than Mr Karagama by the looks of it so I might actually be able to scrape together enough money from savings and student finance to get it done!!!!! Itll mean I can‚Äôt get a car quite so soon but a small price to pay to be able to BURP üò©üò©üò©üòç

Lil update!!! I am speaking to my GP on Tuesday for the referral. If they say no the ENT surgeon who will do the procedure has said he will write to them explaining the procedure and how it is affecting my quality of life and I will just keep trying. (not a great message lol but) I will not take no for an answer at this point, the GP has NO idea how it's affecting my quality of life so if they say no then I will just try another GP until someone takes it seriously. I was a little optimistic in this first post (just overwhelmingly excited to have made some sort of progress after so long) but my life is pretty shitty at this point because of it (I can't eat big meals, I am losing so much weight because of that, I can't have drinks with friends because alcohol sets me off hugely, I have ended relationships because it was so embarrassing having meals with someone and them asking what it was, and the other day someone asked me what that noise was when I was on the phone with them ): ) 

I will keep you all updated!

I GOT THE REFERRAL!!!!! I was expecting SO much resistance but he said I had clearly done my research (I came armed with a named surgeon who wanted to do help, statistics, papers, etc) and didn't even ask questions or made me feel shit he just REFERRED ME!!!!! I'm a medic so I think that helped my confidence in approaching him with using proper medical jargon so maybe he took me more seriously so my advice is just compile the data and GO FOR IT and if it doesn't work the first time try and try and try again!!!!

Title    : Life after botox???
Selftext :
I was recently referred to a laryngologist for the botox procedure but since it's on the NHS it'll be a while before I actually get seen. I'm curious what people have noticed after botox? VERY niche question but will it affect my voice? I'd love if it made me a better singer that'd be a lovely little bonus !!

Title    : Did you vomit as a child at all?
Selftext :
I've just read a post here about getting RCPD after vomiting which made me thing, I NEVER vomited as a child. I vomited when I was 5 and then didn't vomit again till I was 17 (because I had norovirus). I'm 22 now and still can't vomit (or burp obviously) unless I am incredibly drunk and then I guess I'm 'relaxed' enough to force it myself but again it never comes naturally. 

Could that have been because of this? I've had RCPD for as long as I can remember (my mum remembers me gurgling and bloating when I was a kid) so could that have been why I physically couldn't vomit as a child?

SO weird - I wonder if it's related at all?! If I vomit now I definitely have to force myself to do it (lol tb to messy nights out). It definitely doesn't come naturally. I wonder if it's all to do with not being able to relax your throat enough to let ANYTHING out let alone air

There's this website which is aiming to build a database from patients of every single condition. I've used it before to answer questions about some other conditions but it has only just occurred to me that RCPD might be on it too and !!! They only need 29 more people to answer the survey for the RCPD forum to be up and running. I'm a medic and I've already had lots of doctors refer to this website so getting the word out on here might be a really good idea to make this more known!!!

Gosh I really really wonder if there's something in the fact that we are all either emetephobes or just very rarely vomited in childhood. It would kinda make sense if we all had this mental block about being able to open up our throats to burp because we are all scared of vomiting. I know that I have always tried to avoid burping when i was younger because a burp was ALWAYS followed by vomit and I was so scared of vomiting. 

Now I'd give anything to burp and I end up trying to force myself to vomit just to relieve the gurgling ): It would make sense tho as to why so many people are cured after the botox wears off! We get over the mental block of burping so when the botox disappears the block is still gone!

oh god it wasn't easy. but i emailed maybe 50 surgeons in my area (Yorkshire and then worked my way out from there) and they ALL directed me to one surgeon who might be able to help. it turns out he's done this surgery on one woman before so he was very happy to help again! he told me to get a referral to him from my gp. i think it helped massively that i already had a surgeon backing me up and who was willing to do the procedure

Title    : Tongue numbness after surgery
Selftext :
Did anyone experience numbness of the tongue after surgery? I‚Äôm a medic myself so I know the fancy name for it is post-operative lingual neuropraxia, but the papers I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt say how likely it is to recover. Apparently it‚Äôs much more common in head and neck surgery, so it does make sense but I don‚Äôt really want a numb tongue so has anyone had this and had it go away!

PS. I‚Äôm currently 5 hours post-botox so very early stages but I‚Äôve had a lot of nerve damage from previous surgeries so I‚Äôm a bit anxious

Good thank you! I stretched in bed this morning and I guess the pressure of tending my stomach forced a huge burp to come out! A few tiny burps this morning slipping through so doing well! 

My tongue is numb unfortunately but I think that‚Äôs just the anaesthetic intubation tube that was resting on it and caused numbness but everything I‚Äôve read has said it should slowly come back (:

Title    : Day 1 post-botox questions
Selftext :
I had 100units injected yesterday. Since then I‚Äôve had 2 burps (big for me but for someone who doesn‚Äôt have RCPD they‚Äôd probably consider them small burps). I‚Äôve got a lot of gargling still going on though. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just being impatient but when do I ‚Äòlearn‚Äô to properly burp? I feel like I now have all the tools to do it but I can‚Äôt force them out yet! The tiny burps just spring up on me but I can‚Äôt turn them into anything big yet. Is this normal?

Totally normal. I'm day 6 post-botox and this is exactly what I have been like for the past week. I have had to sleep with three pillows like I'm sat up in a chair. Today is the first day where I'm feeling a bit better though! If my worst day was a 10, today is maybe a 6 in terms of severity! I'm able to control the burps a bit more now, I'm having to talk less than usual from fear of some sneaking out in public but that's not been an issue at all. I'm also so much more comfortable today, my throat/neck has felt so tight for the past week but today I'm a lot more relaxed. Stick it out!!!! (not that you have a choice lol)

Title    : One year on from throatox!
Selftext :
Haven‚Äôt been in this sub very much because as the caption states, I‚Äôm a year on from throatox, but it popped up on my feed so I thought I‚Äôd share! 

I had throatox (100units) February 2023. Initial three weeks were rough and I won‚Äôt lie, I regretted it a bit. First week I was just constantly choking. No control over my swallowing so if I took an ambitious bite of anything I would choke. I live alone so I had to get VERY good at throwing my back against the wall to dislodge the food bolus. Second and third weeks I started burping but had no control over it. Any time I opened my mouth to talk I‚Äôd burp. So I spent two weeks mute at work to save me the embarrassment. 

But that‚Äôs it! Once over the initial hump I have NEVER looked back!! The no burpness feels like a distant memory. I have complete control over my burps and haven‚Äôt had a single throat gargle in a year!! I no longer get bloated (this was the most amazing and unexpected effect), literally haven‚Äôt felt bloated in a whole year. I can eat and drink whatever I like. And hell the satisfaction of letting out a huge burp after eating has never worn off. 

No regrets at all. Honestly has been life changing and would recommend throatox to anyone. (:
