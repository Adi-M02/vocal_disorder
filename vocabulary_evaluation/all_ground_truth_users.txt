Gosh I literally had to double check I didn‚Äôt write this post because it is the exact same stuff I have gone through as well and I only found this group yesterday! I‚Äôm going to book an appointment with my GP on Monday but I‚Äôm not too hopeful as from this subreddit we clearly aren‚Äôt known about too much. 

I‚Äôve spent all day compiling sources and papers and articles and everything I can find to prove to my GP that this needs to be taken seriously. And since my gurgling has been unbearable today I‚Äôve recorded all the sounds to show them

I‚Äôve also had this for as long as I can remember but I‚Äôm now having to force myself to vomit multiple times a day and it‚Äôs just wrecking my quality of life. 

Hope you get the answers you need and PLEASE keep posting because as a very very poor student in the same boat I‚Äôll need all the advice I can get

Title    : AMAZING news!!!
Selftext :
Ahhhh, I‚Äôve struggled with RCPD for as long as I can remember but it has recently become unbearable. The other night I couldn‚Äôt cope anymore, I was making myself sick up to ten times a day just to release some air, it was awful, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and email around every local private ENT with special interest in laryngology and this morning I heard back from one saying he would love to help me out!!! He can see me THIS week as a private patient or in a few months as an NHS patient!!! And his fees are SO much less than Mr Karagama by the looks of it so I might actually be able to scrape together enough money from savings and student finance to get it done!!!!! Itll mean I can‚Äôt get a car quite so soon but a small price to pay to be able to BURP üò©üò©üò©üòç

Lil update!!! I am speaking to my GP on Tuesday for the referral. If they say no the ENT surgeon who will do the procedure has said he will write to them explaining the procedure and how it is affecting my quality of life and I will just keep trying. (not a great message lol but) I will not take no for an answer at this point, the GP has NO idea how it's affecting my quality of life so if they say no then I will just try another GP until someone takes it seriously. I was a little optimistic in this first post (just overwhelmingly excited to have made some sort of progress after so long) but my life is pretty shitty at this point because of it (I can't eat big meals, I am losing so much weight because of that, I can't have drinks with friends because alcohol sets me off hugely, I have ended relationships because it was so embarrassing having meals with someone and them asking what it was, and the other day someone asked me what that noise was when I was on the phone with them ): ) 

I will keep you all updated!

I GOT THE REFERRAL!!!!! I was expecting SO much resistance but he said I had clearly done my research (I came armed with a named surgeon who wanted to do help, statistics, papers, etc) and didn't even ask questions or made me feel shit he just REFERRED ME!!!!! I'm a medic so I think that helped my confidence in approaching him with using proper medical jargon so maybe he took me more seriously so my advice is just compile the data and GO FOR IT and if it doesn't work the first time try and try and try again!!!!

Title    : Did you vomit as a child at all?
Selftext :
I've just read a post here about getting RCPD after vomiting which made me thing, I NEVER vomited as a child. I vomited when I was 5 and then didn't vomit again till I was 17 (because I had norovirus). I'm 22 now and still can't vomit (or burp obviously) unless I am incredibly drunk and then I guess I'm 'relaxed' enough to force it myself but again it never comes naturally. 

Could that have been because of this? I've had RCPD for as long as I can remember (my mum remembers me gurgling and bloating when I was a kid) so could that have been why I physically couldn't vomit as a child?

Gosh I really really wonder if there's something in the fact that we are all either emetephobes or just very rarely vomited in childhood. It would kinda make sense if we all had this mental block about being able to open up our throats to burp because we are all scared of vomiting. I know that I have always tried to avoid burping when i was younger because a burp was ALWAYS followed by vomit and I was so scared of vomiting. 

Now I'd give anything to burp and I end up trying to force myself to vomit just to relieve the gurgling ): It would make sense tho as to why so many people are cured after the botox wears off! We get over the mental block of burping so when the botox disappears the block is still gone!

Title    : Tongue numbness after surgery
Selftext :
Did anyone experience numbness of the tongue after surgery? I‚Äôm a medic myself so I know the fancy name for it is post-operative lingual neuropraxia, but the papers I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt say how likely it is to recover. Apparently it‚Äôs much more common in head and neck surgery, so it does make sense but I don‚Äôt really want a numb tongue so has anyone had this and had it go away!

PS. I‚Äôm currently 5 hours post-botox so very early stages but I‚Äôve had a lot of nerve damage from previous surgeries so I‚Äôm a bit anxious

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just being impatient but when do I ‚Äòlearn‚Äô to properly burp? I feel like I now have all the tools to do it but I can‚Äôt force them out yet! The tiny burps just spring up on me but I can‚Äôt turn them into anything big yet. Is this normal?

Title    : One year on from throatox!
Selftext :
Haven‚Äôt been in this sub very much because as the caption states, I‚Äôm a year on from throatox, but it popped up on my feed so I thought I‚Äôd share! 

I had throatox (100units) February 2023. Initial three weeks were rough and I won‚Äôt lie, I regretted it a bit. First week I was just constantly choking. No control over my swallowing so if I took an ambitious bite of anything I would choke. I live alone so I had to get VERY good at throwing my back against the wall to dislodge the food bolus. Second and third weeks I started burping but had no control over it. Any time I opened my mouth to talk I‚Äôd burp. So I spent two weeks mute at work to save me the embarrassment. 

But that‚Äôs it! Once over the initial hump I have NEVER looked back!! The no burpness feels like a distant memory. I have complete control over my burps and haven‚Äôt had a single throat gargle in a year!! I no longer get bloated (this was the most amazing and unexpected effect), literally haven‚Äôt felt bloated in a whole year. I can eat and drink whatever I like. And hell the satisfaction of letting out a huge burp after eating has never worn off. 

No regrets at all. Honestly has been life changing and would recommend throatox to anyone. (:

Title    : questions about air vomiting / chest pains after drinking alcohol?
Selftext :
So all my life I've struggled with not being able to burp (just get gurgling noises that provide no relief, also very scared of vomitting and last time was about 10 years ago..)

When I drink alcohol I normally have lemonade as mixer or something carbonated, I find that after drinking a few I get really intense chest pains and I feel so 'full' that I can't bear to drink anymore (normally before I'm even drunk! So drinking out is a pain..)

Just now I had been out and had like a drink per hour..and twice I had suddenly felt very hot, mouth started salivating and then had to 'air vomit' but I don't even know if this is what's happening. I just like, gag and nothing comes out (but it doesn't seem like air is coming out either? Can you feel it??) But I immediately feel better after doing it. 

It's so weird and embarrassing, I had to leave suddenly to the bathroom as within a minute I suddenly felt this way and did this motion about 3 times then felt completely fine.

Is this air vomitting? Or what is it? Am I just sick from alcohol...but idk because when I drink at home I use a lot less lemonade and stir it a lot so there's not much carbonation, and I can actually get drunk before feeling the chest pain/sickness!

I still have chest pains after the 'air vomits', it doesnt go away, just takes time to wear off. Is this pain related to RCPD or something else??


Thanks all for any help :)

Hmm interesting, yeah it doesn't really sound like much idk. I guess I kind of try hold back because I'm afraid of being actually sick. Normally it's like a  gag / cough / choke kind of...I don't really know how to explain it?  There's a little noise but not *super loud*

So maybe this isn't air vomitting or perhaps just partially..? Maybe I can't make the proper motion of vomiting..when I get sick it's awful because I can't vomit, I just heave and heave cos I literally don't know how to force it out!

Title    : Worried my Botox hasn't worked (Day 3)
Selftext :
Hi everyone.

I had Botox a couple days ago with Lucy Hicklin in the UK.

After the procedure , I had a bit of tenderness and soreness but overall felt fine. I was gurgling quite a lot right after and was hoping one of them would magically turn into a burp, but no, nothing (cus how amazing would that be if not even an HR later I had already burped!)...I can eat just fine too, no slow swallowing, etc...

So it's now morning day 3 and I'm soo paranoid that it's not worked because I'm not feeling any side effects.  

Even if I don't have any side effects, could it still be working?

I don't really understand it, cos I had been reading up others experienced and some burped few days after, some a week, some more. Does the Botox need time to 'kick in' or something? If I had a really tight throat, would a higher dosage of botox be needed and so this dosage might not do anything? ü•≤

I'd been hoping so much that this would help some of my issues as it's getting really bad lately and I will be so upset if I have done it all for nothing. :( 

How long would I have to wait til I can get more injected? 

Any advise or reassurance is welcome please...thank you all!

Title    : 2 weeks post Botox with Lucy Hicklin (1st dose)
Selftext :
Hi, I wrote a small diary for my side effects after Botox with Lucy Hicklin at the centre in Chelsea if anyone is interested. I posted a few weeks ago worried it wasn't working at all but I did manage to get some micro burps and large burps since.

I feel like by the end of the 1st week it seemed to be at the peak and I had a few large burps but mostly I only had micro burps. I also can only burp when I move my head to the right and lean downwards as if I was sniffing my armpit...which is a little bit awkward in public and at work so I'm too afraid to do it. :(  Moving my head about side to side I can find the 'sweet spot' sometimes and continuously moving my head into that spot makes the air come out, it's a bit strange!

 I haven't really managed to burp any other way, I have coughed/yawned a couple times and a burp kind of came with it but that's about it.

I'd say I've had less than 10 'large' burps where I truly felt my throat 'open' and pass the air, also tasted it lol.

Feeling a bit sad that it seems to be wearing off rather than improving, so I'm hoping that a 2nd higher dosage will give greater results as it's clear this injection worked slightly but maybe not quite enough!

14/08/2023
Day 1 - procedure was ok, very nervous for it. Injection was uncomfortable but not too painful. Tiny prick upon needle entering, then 'full' feeling as the Botox was injected. Throat felt 'full' like a lump stuck. Felt a bit light headed afterwards. Throat remained feeling full and like a lump is there, swallowing felt a little different and sore, turning my head/neck felt a little sensitive. When laying down and talking on the phone, my voice felt a little different, kind of 'wobbly'? 

Day 2 - feel completely fine, no different at all..eating fine

Day 3 - same as day 2, when I woke up, but throughout the day my swallowing seems a bit slower / like something stuck in my throat. Food seemed to get stuck in throat too but not near choking, just like something a little stuck where when you swallow so many times the feeling still stays. Also a little bruising, towards left of the centre of my neck

Day 4 - slow swallowing when eating, a few micro burps?! Feeling like there is a bit more trapped air that isn't turning to gurgles which provided a little relief, so it's a bit uncomfy..turned head to right side and lowered head a bit to chest/shoulders, managed to do 3 micro burps like this!! But there's not loads of relief

Day 5 - Still slow swallowing. I can do micro burps by lifting up my arm, opening my mouth and pushing my head towards my armpit like I'm sniffing it .. then little burps come out but they're so tiny and quiet. I videod this (discovered it accidentally after I sniffed my armpit and a burp came out lmao). Not sure if they're providing much relief, I do feel a bit less bloated but could just be placebo effect..

Day 6 - same as before, burping by turning my head and facing down. Did 2 quite big burps, I was sitting in the car and turning my head, these burps had a taste and felt quite forceful so I know they were proper! Felt like my throat was opening up

20/08/23 Day 7 - just micro burps using the head position, no big burps sadly. My stomach pains seem to not be as often / constant which is good.
Had a few large burps between these time. Most of the time still micro 

24/08/23 - feel like I was not burping so much today. I had a few small ones, and a big one, but alot of gurgles! Hope not going backwards!!

27/08/23 - not much burping, more gassy and stomach pains :(

31/08/23 - same as above, feel like not doing much burping, still gurgling, I can pass small amounts of air but larger gurgles get stuck and don't seem to pass. Sometimes I will gurgle/burp at the same time.

I can feel everything, I can feel when it's coming up, about to release, and sometimes it just gets stuck as it's about to and turns into a gurgle 


Hope this is helpful for anyone!

Have you tried experimenting with head positions when you feel the urge to release the air, especially after eating/drinking. Try turning it, left, right, down/up..could maybe have some success there.

I had botox and the first couple weeks after I was able to micro burp but not fully burp. Sadly it's worn off now and am planning my 2nd dose, but while it was in effect I definitely felt my stomach issues were much better! I regularly have all the mentioned issues, stomach pain (usually after eating anything at all, doesn't matter what!), bloating, excess wind, going to the toilet 'too often'....etc.   


I'm hoping my 2nd dose will allow me to burp properly and hopefully these issues will go away too! :)

When I had my first Botox injection, the slow swallow didn't start until day 4 and lasted 1-2 weeks.

I had micro burps and only a handful of proper burps, unfortunately these stopped.

I will be going for 2nd injection in a few months too..

I get a lot of stomach pains especially in the morning like you say...rn I have called off work cus it's that bad. I have only had this level of pain 3-4 times in the past 2 yrs. Basically everyday  I have a constant pain but the pain level fluctuates. 

When I had my first Botox injection (worked for a short while but then stopped) I did feel as though my stomach and pain was much better.

The annoying thing is that the issues could be from RCPD, or it could be something else, but until my RCPD is fixed it will be hard to tell what's causing what..so I'm getting a second injection and hoping it will help.

If my problems persist, then it is most likely something else...IBS, food, whatever..and I will go to the doctor for tests.
My doctor's originally diagnosed me with IBS, but it's hard to handle cos it seems some days certain foods trigger my pain and other days they don't, so makes me think is it really that? Lots of RCPD sufferers get misdiagnosed with all sorts of stomach disorders.

I have been to Lucy Hicklin in London twice. She mentioned Dr Karagama doing a different procedure where he is cutting the muscle? It sounds like it might be more successful as it seems like a more permanent and sure method. I hadn't heard of this before so I have no idea of the specifics though, this is just what she mentioned to me. Maybe you could inquire with him? He is based in London as well.

Title    : Does this sound normal for burping after botox treatment? 'Pop' feeling in my throat
Selftext :
Hi all, so I got my 2nd botox about 2 months ago now. I've had loads of relief and burp alot, however sometimes it seems really excessive.

When I burp, I feel the air coming up and I breathe in, feel a 'pop' in my throat, then I will immediately do a burp. This is usually how it happens, though sometimes the burps will just slip out and I don't breahhe in/do the 'pop'.

Is this 'pop' normal or is it me ingesting more air when breathing in and then immediately releasing it?

I do an excessive amount of burps and usually do massive burps about 50 times for an hour or longer after eating a meal. 

This morning I woke up and was immediately burping, without having even eaten anything? Why?!

It's great to be able to burp but now it feels like a whole other issue!

Has anyone else experienced this and does it wear off? 

Thank you

Yep, since I learned to burp from botox majority of the time I will feel a burp coming, breathe in with a pop, and then burp. It's weird but it does relieve it! But sometimes I will breathe in/pop to burp, but then the burp won't come out (I have experienced that more lately, which is why I thought my botox effects might be wearing off as I struggle to push the burp out a bit more often)

Title    : Lucy Hicklin pricing
Selftext :
Hi all,

Just hoping to get some comments from people about what they've been charged for by Lucy for the procedure.

I had my initial Botox done which was ¬£850 for the consultation and the starting dosage of Botox (1 injection in one part of the throat).   

I then had a follow-up appointment (which was my latest appointment, back in November) as I had no relief from this, which I was advised would be ¬£200 for the same dosage (1 injection) or ¬£250 for increase dosage (2 injections either side of the throat).

I just tried to book in again as I am still burping but feel them getting trapped sometimes and am worried I will soon not be able to burp and wanted to book in for a few months incase I started worsening.

She told me it would be ¬£575, ¬£250 for the injection and the remaining is half of her consultation fee?

I was under the assumption any further doses would be ¬£250 but now getting slapped with more than double the price I wondered if this is the norm?

Anyone else had this? 

Thanks!

Ah true...thank you, I booked in just incase but probably cancel if I don't notice anymore of a decline in my burps.

I'm monitoring it a bit more closely as I noticed the pains coming back (they were basically all gone!) so just worried..

Yeah..when I first got my Botox I was burping like mad, almost too much it was annoying! Any little thing would make me burp alot and got hours. But that's obviously not normal..so maybe I am just expecting too much.

Thank you :)

Fair enough, I did ask for an explanation on the price and her secretary said it is  half the cost of consultation. But I can't see what there is to discuss, I had the injection, it's now worn off and can't burp again, so want to do the same again as a 'top-up' sorta thing.  Sadly have to pay extra ¬£300 or so just because of that :(

Yes, I think that's what it is. I didn't realise the ¬£250 was just a 'generosity' fee as it didn't work out so she just charge for the cost of the Botox / needle etc.

But as it's now worked, the generosity discount is gone so I got to pay for the other bits at half the price. 

Makes sense now!

A month or so. The first month I had the usual side effects and also burped far too frequently to the point it was just as annoying as not being able to burp! I'd just wake up and already be burping, then eating food and I would burp for hours after every minute or so. The good thing was that they never felt trapped, but it was just far too much! Those burps were also very loud and 'powerful'. That eventually subsided, and I'm now at 6 months post-botox and I'm still burping. I do feel like sometimes they get trapped and it worries me, but I think that is kind of normal. My burps are nowhere near as loud/big anymore, they are quite quiet and small. My stomach pains happen a bit more often compared to when I was burping so much, but it's still nowhere near what it was when I couldn't burp at all (everyday, after eating, at night when digesting food was when it was at it's worse). So I'd say 1-2 months before it feels 'normal'.

It's only because she is based in UK and we only have 2 options for treatment in the UK. The only other option is Dr karagama and he does surgery under anesthesia which is thousands of ¬£¬£. Lucky hicklin does Botox injections for about ¬£800 on first appointment, if doesn't succeed at all then she will do again for about ¬£250 after. Anything else after that will be ¬£575. 

So Lucy hicklin will be the obvious choice for most UK people :) I'm not sure about US doctors sorry.

Hi everyone! I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm a 28 year old woman and I‚Äôve never been able to burp. Every now and then I have what I like to call ‚Äúbaby burps‚Äù that really aren‚Äôt burps at all but just a little air that comes out. Still, the worst part for me is the hiccups.

I get horribly painful hiccups for prolonged periods of time. I‚Äôve recently learned of this subreddit and of R-CPD and was curious if anyone knows if bad hiccups are part of this condition or if it‚Äôs just me?

I do have a question though: what was the surgery like? Did you have go to under anesthesia? I know you said your throat was sore for a few days but was there any other pain/side effects? Also, what was the process like with Dr. Bastian? Sorry, I know I ask a lot of questions lol üòÇ

2. How long is the recovery time?

4. How is it now? Can you control when the burps come out? I know you said it was life changing but more specifically - like what are the feelings now? Do you get any of those same pains or gurgling noises sometimes?

Sorry, I know it‚Äôs a lot of questions but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm considering and don‚Äôt want to go into it blind. I‚Äôd want to see Dr Bastian but I know he‚Äôs in Chicago and I‚Äôm in NJ so I‚Äôd have to fly out to see him and want to make sure it‚Äôs worth it.

Title    : 2 Months Post-Op! (General Anesthesia)
Selftext :
Hey everyone! I got the Botox injection under general anesthesia 2 months ago now from Dr. Hayley Born in NYC and wanted to share some thoughts that would have helped me when I was considering the procedure. 

Please note that even my doctor told me that I was on a the higher side of adverse side effects from the procedure, so please take this with a grain of salt - but I'm someone who would have liked to have known all of the possibilities, so I'm sure some of you do too. 

1. General anesthesia 

* General anesthesia was a great idea for me specifically because I wouldn't be able to go to the doctor's office several times to get the in-office injections, whereas I could take a day off from work to have the outpatient procedure done, and not have to come back to the office.
* However, I did end up having a reaction to the anesthesia for a couple of days where my ENTIRE body felt like I just done the most intense workout of my life, especially in my calves, abdomen and arms. I seriously could not get out of bed without help because I couldn't use my abs to lift the top part of my body. It went away after a couple days, and apparently this is a common side effect of anesthesia, but it had never happened to me and I've had several surgeries, so thought it was worth noting.

2. Regurgitation and Slow Swallow

* Regurgitation: This is something I had seen on this subreddit but I didn't really pay any mind to at the time. This was a HUGE deal for me for about a month. The problem with this specific injection of Botox is that it basically paralyzes the muscle around the esophageal sphincter, which helps air escape the muscle and come back up in the form of a burp.... It also comes back in the form of whatever you've had to eat or drink. 
   * Phlegmy air bubbles (I called them the "gurglies"). The best way to describe this is having a lot of phlegm at the back of your throat but even after you clear it, it just keeps coming back. This was a scary one for me because I had never heard of anyone having these symptoms. It would get in the way of my breathing through my mouth, talking, and eating. 
* Slow Swallow: I know for a fact that some people did not experience this or did not experience it nearly as badly, but I know some people do have this issue so I just want to explain what it's like so they know what's "normal":
   * Coughing fits where something just seems to get caught in your throat and nothing will clear it until you regurgitate or vomit and get whatever is stuck, out. This was super uncomfortable, and made eating out at restaurants difficult. I did, in fact, have this problem at a restaurant and it didn't end well.
   * I can't emphasize this enough: DRINK WATER AFTER ALL OR ALMOST ALL BITES OF FOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER!! You're going to get to a point where you think "fuck it, I can eat five bites of pasta before I need a sip of water" but you DO need it, I promise it will help. 
      * In addition to that, LISTEN to what your body is telling you. If you've eaten and gotten to a point where you can start to feel the food you've eaten getting more and more stuck in your throat and needing more and more water to wash it down, STOP EATING. If it's so close to the surface and not going down smoothly, there's a good chance you might regurgitate it, and nothing feels worse than having to regurgitate food and wait until your next meal to eat. 

3. Acid Reflux

* Speaking of eating.... wowza. The Acid Reflux was a BIG problem for me. Here are the things I did to help:
   * Eat less tomatoes/tomato sauces
   * Eat more things high in fiber (chickpeas, potatoes, broccoli, whole grain bread, smoothies, etc)
   * Elevate while sleeping!
   * NO CARBONATED BEVERAGES - I know this feels like it defeats the purpose of getting the botox injection, but the carbonation will not sit well in your stomach. Give your body some time to reach the plateau of the Botox injection (about a month to a month and a half) and then you can go back carbonated beverages. Trust me, you'll still burp in the meantime.
   * No Alcohol. (If you're going to drink anyway, do it in very small quantities and very infrequently)
   * Ask your doctor if you should be taking anything like Gaviscon or even Famotidine (forgive me if I'm spelling that wrong) to help with your reflux. FAM really helped me a lot, but it takes a few days to start to work. 

4. Sleep

* Again, this is one of those things that not everyone experienced but it was a big deal for me - sleeping. 
* Because my regurgitation and acid reflux was so bad, I was forced to sleep pretty much totally upright for almost 2 months. At the month/month and a half mark I noticed I would scootch down more and more every night to get comfortable and now I'm only slightly elevated while sleeping. I'm glad I listened to my body and started reclining more when my body said it was okay with it. 

5. General tips:

* Bring water with you everywhere
* Eat slowly and deliberately. 
* Chew your food until it's paste
* Work at your body's pace. Let your body tell you what it needs and can't have. 
   * This is actually very important. I thought that since I was having issues with slow swallow I should only eat soft foods, but it turned out that soft foods just made it worse for me - it didn't slide down my throat like I would have liked. So actually, things that soaked up moisture worked better and then I could take a swig of water and it would go right down. (Breads, pastas, tortilla chips were my lifesavers)
* Don't freak out if your journey is different than someone else's. Our bodies are all different and we experience side effects, healing, and medications all very differently. Talk to your doctor, don't worry about feeling like you're asking too many questions - they are there to answer them and to help you get whatever help you need. There's no such thing as stupid question. 

6. BURPING!!!

* Here's the good stuff! Burping is wild. It feels good, but gross, and it's both happens on it's own and sometimes you have to force it. The best way I can describe what a burp feels like is that it's like a airy vibration in your throat.
   * Some things to note: you CAN force a burp! It doesn't just sit there causing you pain! You sort of have to push your tongue down to the bottom of your mouth, extend your neck a little bit, and exert a little pressure from your throat muscles. I also read from someone else on the subreddit that you can look to your left and look up and sometimes that helps too. 

Overall, I'm SO glad I got this procedure done. It sounds scary and there are a lot of moving parts to recovery (at least there were for me) but the fact that I can burp, I'm not bloated all the time, I'm not in pain, my hiccups aren't nearly as frequent nor are they painful, and I can eat/drink whatever I want without feeling like I'll pay for it later -- it's such a freeing feeling!

I hope this helps someone! It would have been great for me to know I wasn't alone in all of this at the beginning, and that a lot of the things I was feeling were normal, even if they were on the more extreme side of normal.

I wish everyone good luck on their journey. 

May we all be burping the alphabet any day now!

Great questions! I‚Äôm not actually sure the amount of Botox I got, but certainly more than you would get in the in-office procedure. They can‚Äôt give you that much in-office because they‚Äôre going in kind of blind (that‚Äôs why they only do one side of your throat at a time - usually about 2-4 office visits are required), but when they do general anesthesia they can see where they‚Äôre poking so they can inject a much higher dose. 

As for regurgitation:
the best way I can explain it is that unlike vomiting, where it comes after nausea and is usually somewhat painful because your body is trying to push it out of your stomach; regurgitation is more like there‚Äôs nothing is blocking the stomach contents from coming up, so it just sort of slides out. 
The regurgitation itself can be different depending on what you‚Äôre eating, how long it‚Äôs been since you ate, what positions you‚Äôre in.

If you didn‚Äôt eat for a while but you had a sip of water, only the water might come up and you can either spit it out or swallow it. But if you have a coughing fit after you‚Äôve eaten, you might kind of projectile whatever you‚Äôve just eaten. I handled it by eating smaller portions, eating slower, and drinking water in between sips so nothing irritated my throat to make me cough. 

But it could also just happen because of how you‚Äôre positioned. For example, bending down was not really an option for me unless I did it the way pregnant women do (bend down with your knees, lean back, and grab with your hand without bending over) because stuff would just come up.

But on the whole, I wouldn‚Äôt let the regurgitation hold you back from doing it. It‚Äôs unpleasant, for sure. But the freedom and weight that is lifted by having done this procedure FARRRR outweighs the negatives. You just have to be cognizant of your limitations for a few weeks. A lot of people don‚Äôt even get regurgitation and MUCH LESS people get it as bad as I had it. I was definitely in the extreme camp. Hope that answers your questions!

Well the good news is it‚Äôll be contained, lol! I would just bring a bowl with you while you scoop in case you need to cough anything up. You can even sit down on the floor and clean that way. Keep in mind, if you clean the litter boxes around when you first wake up before you eat, or several hours after you eat, you‚Äôll probably be able to bend like normal with nothing coming up. It‚Äôs only a problem when you have undigested food in your stomach.

Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Mine stopped around week 4, and since then it‚Äôs just been little things here and there if I over-eat or try to bend too soon after eating. I still get the gurglies sometimes but much much much less. My doctor explained to me that the height of the Botox injection‚Äôs effectiveness is basically between the first and the third week. So once you hit that three to four week mark, things start to get better.

It‚Äôs a slow process, and kind of a sucky one, but I promise you it‚Äôll get better and you‚Äôll be happy you did the procedure even with the issues.

I will say that I don‚Äôt really feel like my doctor walked me through all of the negative side effects as well as I think she should have. All of my questions were answered honestly, but I obviously would not have known to ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the regurgitation process like? how long does it last? and what can I do about it?‚Äù. I feel she should have those answers already and provided it without me asking since it seems to be a big part of the healing process.

I hope you feel better soon! If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out here or in DMs!

I wouldn‚Äôt be worried at all. I didn‚Äôt have any microburps until about a week in. I saw when I was looking for the same thing that some people didn‚Äôt get microburps for like 2 or 3 weeks, but the injection eventually did its job. 

I‚Äôd try forcing them a little when you think they‚Äôre close to the surface. I don‚Äôt know if it helps at all or if it‚Äôs psychological but I‚Äôve been able to force all of my burps out in due time (even it takes like 10-15 minutes), and I think it has to do with me associating the feeling of forcing it out with it happening. I‚Äôm not a doctor though, so that might be bullshit lol. Did you get in-office injections or general anesthesia?

I‚Äôm feeling great! Burping is definitely weird and I don‚Äôt have control of it, but the pain and bloating is gone, and my experiences with acid reflux are also gone (as long as I don‚Äôt eat too many tomatoes). I‚Äôm not sure about her experience with hEDS, but she was extremely knowledgeable about RCPD.

I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs been a doctor for at least a decade in the ENT realm. I think she moved over to working with patients with RCPD like 5 years ago or something. She has a vast amount of knowledge, though, and was able to answer all of my questions and then some. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about her credibility in the slightest :)

Title    : Post-Botox diary - success 
Selftext :
I had 50 units from Dr Hicklin on Monday. Here is my diary so far.

Day one:
The injection was fine and just felt like a normal injection, it wasn‚Äôt painful but felt weird and unnatural obviously, but fine.

Straight after injection I felt a bit light headed but it went after around 10 minutes. 

My throat felt slightly strange and slightly painful when I swallowed for the whole day but nothing terrible.

Day two:

The throat pain has passed and I feel normal however my voice feels weak.

Eating feels normal and I am having unusual gurgles in my throat after meals and feel very full even when eating small amount.

Day three:

Slow swallow has definitely started. Feels like you‚Äôre about to choke after a bite of food until you have some water then it mostly goes. It isn‚Äôt actually too bad you just need to get used to it. I‚Äôm guessing it will get worse though as it‚Äôs only day three.

Having lots of small involuntary microburps

Day four:
 
A couple of microburps throughout the day. Slow swallow is a bit difficult but fine if I don‚Äôt have dry foods and have water whilst eating.

In the evening I started drinking carbonated drinks to see if I could burp. I ended up having around 10 proper burps.

Day five:

Slow swallow is still here but easily manageable. I‚Äôm now having proper burps without having to drink carbonated drinks to trigger them. However they only come out if I turn my head to the side.

acid reflux can be a symptom of not being able to burp, there are some exercises you can do which are meant to relax your UES and some people have been able to burp from doing it:

cricoid massage
shaker exercise

also some people air vomit or kinda of like beat the throat to try and force air out but I dont do this. 

everyone has their own symptoms for this, we've just got to live on I'm afraid unless you get treatment. try the shaker exercise and see how it goes and keep trying it cos you never know it could work :)

Title    : I can burp now kinda (no botox)
Selftext :
so it all started a couple weeks back when I started trying the shaker exercise, I did this every day for 3 weeks or so and didnt get much luck probably a micro burp every 2 or 3 days, so I decided to stop as I didnt think it was working, but then 3 days ago I thought let's try it again, so I started doing the shaker exercise again and along with the 30 neck crunches exercise and now I'm micro burping so much its unbelievable, I feel like each day they're getting more forceful so I'm gonna carry on doing these exercises and hopefully I can strengthen them, so far I've dont 30+ microburps today with 2 being quite loud, has anyone got any tips on how I could strengthen them n make them more louder and more powerful

Title    : serious question about once you've learned to burp
Selftext :
if you taught yourself how to burp by doing the shaker exercise and other exercises, what are the chances of losing the ability to burp once you gained that ability by exercises?

you know the shaker exercise how you lift your neck so your chin touches your chest, instead of holding it just keep lifting your neck up and down so your chest touches your chest and repeat it 20-30 times
